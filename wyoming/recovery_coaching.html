            <h2>Critical Recommendations</h2>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>Ethical Imperative</h3>
                <p>The ABSENCE of regulation increases (not decreases) practitioners' ethical responsibility. You must impose on yourself the standards that the state does not require.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Despite Lack of State Requirements, You Should:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Obtain Voluntary Training and Certification:</strong> Complete comprehensive training and consider national certifications (CARC, NCPRSS, etc.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Form LLC or Business Entity:</strong> CRITICAL for liability protection</li>
                    <li><strong>Get Professional Liability Insurance:</strong> ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL in unregulated environment</li>
                    <li><strong>Develop Comprehensive Contracts:</strong> Clear service agreements and policies</li>
                    <li><strong>Create Code of Ethics:</strong> Establish your own professional standards</li>
                    <li><strong>Provide Informed Consent:</strong> Explain you are NOT a licensed professional</li>
                    <li><strong>Establish Referral Network:</strong> Connections with licensed professionals</li>
                    <li><strong>Engage in Continuing Education:</strong> Even though not required</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Employment Outlook</h2>

            </div>

            <h2>Important Warnings</h2>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>"Anyone Can Call Themselves a Recovery Coach":</strong> With no title protection, consumers cannot distinguish qualified coaches from unqualified ones.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Safety Net:</strong> If disputes arise, there is no regulatory board to provide guidance, mediate complaints, or protect consumers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Liability is Personal:</strong> Without regulatory framework, you bear full personal liability. LLC and insurance are CRITICAL.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unauthorized Practice Risk Remains:</strong> Even though recovery coaching is unregulated, crossing into licensed professional territory is still illegal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consumer Vulnerability:</strong> Without state oversight, consumers have minimal protection from unqualified or unethical practitioners.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <h3>Bottom Line for Wyoming</h3>
                <p>Maximum freedom requires maximum responsibility. Without state regulation to guide and protect, recovery coaches in Wyoming must create their own professional standards, protect themselves and their clients through voluntary measures, and bear full personal responsibility for the quality and safety of their services.</p>
