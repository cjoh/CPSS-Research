**Key Finding:** Wyoming represents one of the LEAST regulated environments for recovery coaching in the United States. There is NO state regulation, NO certification requirement, NO mandatory training, and NO restrictions on practice. This creates maximum flexibility but also maximum risk and responsibility for practitioners.

**Critical Implications:**

**Advantages of Completely Unregulated Status:**
1. NO state certification fees or requirements
2. NO mandatory training or education requirements
3. NO examination requirements
4. NO supervision mandates
5. Complete flexibility in practice structure
6. Can start practicing immediately
7. Can set own qualifications and standards
8. NO renewal processes
9. NO continuing education requirements
10. NO state bureaucracy or oversight

**Risks of Completely Unregulated Status:**
1. NO legal protection of "recovery coach" title (anyone can use it)
2. NO regulatory guidance on scope of practice
3. NO state oversight or accountability framework
4. Significant liability exposure without regulatory structure
5. NO recourse to state board if disputes arise
6. Must completely self-determine ethical boundaries
7. Must avoid unauthorized practice of licensed professions on your own
8. NO standardized qualifications for consumers to evaluate
9. NO state-backed credentialing for professional credibility
10. Consumers have no regulatory protection

**Wyoming's Position:**
Wyoming shares with South Dakota the distinction of being among the LEAST regulated states for recovery coaching. The complete absence of any state framework makes it similar to the "Wild West" - maximum freedom with maximum personal responsibility.

**Comparison:**
- **Most Regulated:** Tennessee, Ohio, Utah, Nevada (statutory requirements, supervision, organizational employment)
- **Moderately Regulated:** Pennsylvania, Virginia, Texas (voluntary certification, some structure)
- **Unregulated:** Oregon, Washington, South Carolina (no specific regulation found)
- **LEAST Regulated:** **Wyoming, South Dakota** (completely unregulated, no framework whatsoever)

   - Develop comprehensive contracts and service agreements

   - Have clear policies:
     - Informed consent
     - Confidentiality (and its limits)
     - Cancellation/termination
     - Payment
     - Emergencies
     - Referral protocols
   - Consult with attorney about service agreements and liability
   - Consider tax implications and business structure

5. **Client Protection Measures:**
   - Provide detailed informed consent explaining:
     - You are NOT a licensed professional
     - Your specific qualifications and training
     - Scope and limitations of services

     - National standards

**Important Warnings:**

1. **"Anyone Can Call Themselves a Recovery Coach":** With no title protection, consumers cannot distinguish qualified coaches from unqualified ones. This creates marketplace confusion and potential harm.

2. **No Safety Net:** If disputes arise, there is no regulatory board to provide guidance, mediate complaints, or protect consumers.

3. **Liability is Personal:** Without regulatory framework, you bear full personal liability for your services. LLC and insurance are CRITICAL.

4. **Unauthorized Practice Risk Remains:** Even though recovery coaching is unregulated, crossing into licensed professional territory (counseling, therapy, social work, etc.) is still illegal.

5. **Consumer Vulnerability:** Without state oversight, consumers have minimal protection from unqualified or unethical practitioners.

**Ethical Imperative:**
The ABSENCE of regulation increases (not decreases) practitioners' ethical responsibility. You must impose on yourself the standards that the state does not require.

**Considerations for Starting Practice in Wyoming:**

**Advantages:**
- Immediate start possible
- No bureaucratic barriers
- Complete autonomy
- No licensing costs
- Set own standards
- Flexibility in approach

**Responsibilities:**
- Define own qualifications
- Establish ethical framework
- Create safety protocols
- Protect clients without state oversight
- Manage all liability risks
- Build professional credibility without state backing
- Educate consumers about what you offer

**For More Information:**
- Wyoming Department of Health, Behavioral Health Division (general information only)
- National certification boards (NAADAC, IC&RC)
- Professional recovery coach associations
- Attorney familiar with Wyoming health care and business law
- Insurance broker for professional liability coverage

**Future Considerations:**
Wyoming may develop recovery coach regulations in future as behavioral health workforce needs evolve. Stay informed about:
- Legislative developments
- Department of Health initiatives
- Behavioral health workforce policies
- National trends in regulation

**Bottom Line for Wyoming:**
Maximum freedom requires maximum responsibility. Without state regulation to guide and protect, recovery coaches in Wyoming must create their own professional standards, protect themselves and their clients through voluntary measures, and bear full personal responsibility for the quality and safety of their services.

This entrepreneurial freedom can be empowering for qualified practitioners but dangerous for consumers if practitioners do not voluntarily adopt rigorous professional and ethical standards.
