# Alabama Recovery Coaching Legal Requirements
**Research Date:** January 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Coaching

**Status:** State-defined term for recovery support services

**Definition:** Alabama uses the term "Certified Recovery Support Specialist (CRSS)" rather than "recovery coach." A CRSS is defined as:

> "A person living in recovery with a substance use disorder working within an agency or organization who has been trained and certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health (ADMH) to use their personal recovery story to assist others in developing their personal plan for recovery."

**Citation:** Alabama Department of Mental Health, Office of Peer Programs administrative guidelines

**Note:** This is administratively defined, not in state statute. Recovery coaching as an independent activity is not legally defined.

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**What does state law say?**
No specific Alabama statute distinguishes between coaching and therapy for unlicensed practitioners.

**Prohibited Activities:**
While not specifically enumerated for recovery coaches, Alabama law regulates the practice of psychology, counseling, and social work. Recovery coaches who engage in the following would likely be practicing without a license:
- Psychological assessment or diagnosis
- Treatment planning requiring clinical judgment
- Therapy or counseling services
- Presenting themselves as licensed professionals

**Scope of Practice (CRSS):**
Certified Recovery Support Specialists provide:
- Role modeling showing recovery is possible
- Coping skills and positive attitude skills
- Facilitation of peer support/self-help groups
- Connecting individuals to resources
- Sharing lived experience

**Citation:** ADMH CRSS Training Curriculum

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Can recovery coaches operate independently?**
**STATUS: UNCLEAR - Not explicitly addressed**

The CRSS certification is designed for individuals working "within an agency or organization." However, there is no explicit prohibition on independent practice for uncertified recovery coaches.

**Key Factors:**
1. **CRSS Certification:** Designed for employment in agencies, not independent practice
2. **Funding Tied to Employment:** ADMH-funded positions require CRSS certification
3. **No Licensing Law:** Alabama does not license recovery coaches, suggesting independent practice is not prohibited if not engaging in regulated activities

**Certification Requirements (if working as CRSS):**
- Minimum 2 years of continuous demonstrated recovery
- Willing to self-identify as person in recovery
- High school diploma or GED
- Valid driver's license
- Two written references
- 40 hours ADMH-approved CRSS training
- Pass exam with minimum 70% score
- 16 CEUs annually after first year

**Interventionists:** No separate regulatory framework found for interventionists.

## Summary

**Is "recovery coaching" legally defined?**
- No - "Certified Recovery Support Specialist" is administratively defined for those working in ADMH-funded programs
- "Recovery coach" as independent practitioner is not legally defined

**Coaching vs. Therapy boundary?**
- Not explicitly defined in statute for recovery coaches
- Must avoid activities requiring psychology, counseling, or social work licensure
- CRSS scope limited to peer support, not clinical services

**Independent practice allowed?**
- Not explicitly prohibited for unlicensed recovery coaches
- CRSS certification tied to agency employment
- No licensing requirement = no prohibition, but must avoid regulated activities

**Interventionists regulated differently?**
- No information found

## Practical Implications

1. **Working as CRSS:** Must be employed by organization, complete 40-hour training, maintain certification
2. **Working as independent recovery coach:** Appears permissible if not using CRSS title and not engaging in regulated professional activities
3. **Risk Management:** Should avoid any activities that could be construed as therapy, counseling, or clinical assessment
