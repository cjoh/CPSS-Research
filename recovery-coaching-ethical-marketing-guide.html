            <h1>Recovery Coaching Ethical Marketing and Practice Guide</h1>
<h2>Per-State Guide for Navigating the Gray Line</h2>

<strong>Document Date:</strong> November 5, 2025
<strong>Purpose:</strong> To help recovery coaches market their practices ethically and legally while serving clients in the critical post-rehab integration phase

<hr>

<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>

<h3>The Gray Line: Recovery Coaching vs. Therapy</h3>

<strong>Who This Guide Is For:</strong>
<p>Recovery coaches who work with individuals who are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Out of active rehab/treatment</li>
<li>In recovery (not actively using)</li>
<li>Need support integrating recovery tools into daily life</li>
<li>Require accountability and peer support</li>
<li>Benefit from someone with lived experience</li>
</ul>

<strong>The Critical Distinction:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recovery Coaching:</strong> Peer support, accountability, goal-setting, resource connection, sharing lived experience</li>
<li><strong>Therapy/Counseling:</strong> Diagnosis, treatment of mental health/substance use disorders, psychotherapy, clinical treatment</li>
</ul>

<h3>Universal Ethical Requirements for Recovery Coaches</h3>

<p>Regardless of state, ethical recovery coaches should:</p>

1. <strong>Ensure Client Has Therapy Support</strong>
<p>- Client must be working with (or have access to) a licensed therapist or counselor</p>
<p>- Recovery coaching complements therapy; it does not replace it</p>
<p>- For clients with substance use disorder history, ongoing clinical support is essential</p>

2. <strong>Verify Client Is In Recovery</strong>
<p>- Client should be out of acute treatment phase</p>
<p>- Should have established sobriety/recovery (timeframe varies by approach)</p>
<p>- Should have clinical support system in place</p>
<p>- Active users in crisis need clinical intervention, not coaching</p>

3. <strong>Make Outbound Referrals</strong>
<p>- Maintain referral network of licensed professionals</p>
<p>- Refer immediately when client presents with:</p>
<p>- Suicidal ideation</p>
<p>- Active substance use relapse requiring medical intervention</p>
<p>- Severe mental health crisis</p>
<p>- Symptoms beyond coaching scope</p>
<p>- Document referrals appropriately</p>

4. <strong>Clear Scope Definition</strong>
<p>- Use coaching language, not clinical language</p>
<p>- Clearly state you are not a therapist</p>
<p>- Written agreements defining scope of support</p>
<p>- Transparency about your lived experience and training</p>

<h3>Marketing Language Framework</h3>

<strong>SAFE Recovery Coaching Language:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Supporting your recovery journey"</li>
<li>"Peer support from someone with lived experience"</li>
<li>"Accountability and goal-setting for sustainable recovery"</li>
<li>"Helping you integrate recovery tools into daily life"</li>
<li>"Recovery planning and resource connection"</li>
<li>"Post-rehab life integration support"</li>
</ul>

<strong>AVOID - Crosses Into Therapy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Treating addiction" or "treating mental health conditions"</li>
<li>"Diagnosing substance use disorders"</li>
<li>"Therapy for addiction"</li>
<li>"Counseling services"</li>
<li>"Clinical treatment"</li>
<li>"Curing" or "fixing" your addiction</li>
</ul>

<h2>STATE-BY-STATE GUIDE</h2>

<h3>ALABAMA</h3>

<strong>Legal Status:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Certification available: Certified Recovery Support Specialist (CRSS)</li>
<li>Regulatory Body: Alabama Department of Mental Health (ADMH)</li>
<li>Certification required for ADMH-funded programs; not required for independent practice</li>
<li>Life coaching is unregulated</li>
</ul>

<strong>Marketing Guidelines:</strong>

✅ <strong>YOU CAN SAY:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Certified Recovery Support Specialist providing peer support"</li>
<li>"Helping you navigate life after treatment"</li>
<li>"Accountability partner for your recovery journey"</li>
<li>"Connecting you to community recovery resources"</li>
</ul>

❌ <strong>DO NOT SAY:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Treating addiction or substance use disorders"</li>
<li>"Providing therapy or counseling"</li>
<li>"Diagnosing mental health conditions"</li>
</ul>

<strong>Who You CAN Work With:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Individuals who have completed inpatient/outpatient treatment</li>
<li>People in recovery (minimum 2 years recovery if pursuing CRSS)</li>
<li>Clients who have established relationship with therapist/psychiatrist</li>
<li>Individuals seeking peer support and accountability</li>
<li>Those needing help integrating 12-step or other recovery principles</li>
</ul>

<strong>Who You CANNOT Work With:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Individuals actively using substances without medical supervision</li>
<li>People in acute mental health crisis</li>
<li>Those needing clinical diagnosis or treatment</li>
<li>Anyone who refuses to engage with licensed clinical support</li>
<li>Individuals who should be in inpatient treatment</li>
</ul>

<strong>Ethical Requirements:</strong>

1. <strong>Therapist Relationship:</strong>
<p>- Client must have identified therapist or counselor</p>
<p>- If client doesn't have one, first step is referral to clinical support</p>
<p>- Get client's signed release to coordinate (but maintain appropriate boundaries)</p>

2. <strong>Recovery Verification:</strong>
<p>- Client should be out of acute treatment phase</p>
<p>- If pursuing CRSS: you need 2 years recovery; model this standard</p>
<p>- Client should have recovery plan from treatment provider</p>

3. <strong>Referral Network:</strong>
<p>- Alabama licensed professional counselors (LPCs)</p>
<p>- Licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs)</p>
<p>- Licensed marriage and family therapists (LMFTs)</p>
<p>- Psychiatrists for medication management</p>
<p>- Crisis: Alabama Crisis Services 1-800-273-8255</p>

<strong>The Gray Line in Alabama:</strong>
<ul>
<li>CRSS certification is for agency-funded work; independent recovery coaching is less regulated</li>
<li>Key boundary: peer support and lived experience sharing (coaching) vs. clinical treatment (therapy)</li>
<li>If you're helping someone apply recovery principles to life challenges = coaching</li>
<li>If you're treating the underlying disorder = therapy (need license)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Practical Guidance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Consider getting CRSS certification even for private practice (credibility)</li>
<li>Use clear coaching agreements stating you're not providing clinical services</li>
<li>Maintain professional liability insurance</li>
<li>Document when you make referrals to clinical providers</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>CALIFORNIA</h3>

<strong>Legal Status:</strong>
<ul>
<li>No specific recovery coach statute</li>
<li>"Practice protection" state - activity matters, not title</li>
<li>If you're "modifying behaviors for mental health treatment" you need license</li>
<li>Peer support specialists recognized for Medicaid services</li>
<li>Life coaching unregulated but must avoid licensed practice scope</li>
</ul>

<strong>Marketing Guidelines:</strong>

✅ <strong>YOU CAN SAY:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Recovery peer support and accountability"</li>
<li>"Helping you apply recovery principles to daily life"</li>
<li>"Life skills coaching in recovery context"</li>
<li>"Supporting your recovery goals and milestones"</li>
</ul>

❌ <strong>DO NOT SAY:</strong>
<ul>
<li>"Treating your addiction"</li>
<li>"Modifying your behaviors to treat substance use"</li>
<li>"Therapy for co-occurring disorders"</li>
<li>"Diagnosing or assessing addiction"</li>
</ul>

<strong>Who You CAN Work With:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Post-treatment individuals in stable recovery</li>
<li>Clients with active therapist relationship</li>
<li>Those needing help implementing treatment plans (not creating them)</li>
<li>People seeking peer support and structure</li>
<li>Individuals working on recovery-related goals (employment, relationships, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Who You CANNOT Work With:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Individuals needing behavior modification for mental health treatment</li>
<li>Those requiring clinical diagnosis or assessment</li>
<li>Active users without medical supervision</li>
<li>Anyone in psychiatric crisis</li>
<li>People who should be in clinical treatment</li>
</ul>

<strong>Ethical Requirements:</strong>

1. <strong>Therapist Relationship:</strong>
<p>- CRITICAL in California: Client must have licensed provider</p>
<p>- You're supporting implementation of clinical treatment, not providing it</p>
<p>- Get clarity on what clinician is treating vs. what you're coaching</p>

2. <strong>Recovery Verification:</strong>
<p>- Client should be in recovery, not active use</p>
<p>- Should have treatment plan from licensed provider</p>
<p>- Should be in aftercare or ongoing clinical support</p>

3. <strong>Referral Network:</strong>
<p>- California licensed professional clinical counselors (LPCCs)</p>
<p>- Licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs)</p>
<p>- Licensed marriage and family therapists (LMFTs)</p>
<p>- Board certified addiction treatment counselors</p>
<p>- Crisis: CA Suicide Prevention Lifeline 1-800-273-8255</p>

<strong>The Gray Line in California:</strong>
<ul>
<li>California's "practice protection" makes this especially important</li>
<li>It's NOT about what you call yourself; it's about what you DO</li>
<li>Key distinction: Are you modifying behaviors to treat disorder (therapy) or supporting application of recovery tools (coaching)?</li>
<li>If you're addressing the clinical disorder itself = need license</li>
<li>If you're providing peer support on living in recovery = coaching</li>
</ul>

<strong>Practical Guidance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Separate your practice completely from any clinical practice</li>
<li>Use separate agreements, forms, intake documents</li>
<li>Clear disclaimers that you're not providing clinical services</li>
<li>Consider certification as Peer Support Specialist for credibility</li>
<li>Professional liability insurance essential</li>
<li>Stay far away from clinical language in all materials</li>
</ul>

<strong>California-Specific Critical Notes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is HIGH RISK state due to practice protection laws</li>
<li>Be more conservative here than in other states</li>
<li>Document client's clinical support meticulously</li>
<li>If in doubt, refer out</li>
</ul>

<h2>UNIVERSAL ETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR ALL STATES</h2>

<h3>The Three Non-Negotiables</h3>

<strong>1. CLIENT MUST HAVE THERAPIST</strong>
<ul>
<li>Before engaging in recovery coaching, verify client has:</li>
</ul>
<p>- Licensed therapist or counselor</p>
<p>- Psychiatrist (if medication management needed)</p>
<p>- Clinical addiction specialist</p>
<ul>
<li>If client doesn't have clinical support:</li>
</ul>
<p>- FIRST step is referral to appropriate licensed provider</p>
<p>- Do not begin coaching until clinical relationship established</p>
<p>- This protects both you and client</p>

<strong>2. CLIENT MUST BE IN RECOVERY</strong>
<ul>
<li>Client should be:</li>
</ul>
<p>- Out of acute treatment/detox phase</p>
<p>- Established in recovery (timeframe varies but generally stable)</p>
<p>- Not actively using without medical supervision</p>
<p>- Connected to recovery support (12-step, SMART Recovery, etc.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Active users in crisis need clinical intervention, not coaching</li>
<li>If client relapses during coaching:</li>
</ul>
<p>- Immediately connect with clinical provider</p>
<p>- May need to pause coaching until stabilized</p>
<p>- Clinical team handles crisis, not you</p>

<strong>3. YOU MUST MAKE OUTBOUND REFERRALS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Maintain robust referral network:</li>
</ul>
<p>- Licensed professional counselors (LPCs/LCPCs)</p>
<p>- Licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs)</p>
<p>- Licensed marriage and family therapists (LMFTs)</p>
<p>- Psychiatrists for medication management</p>
<p>- Intensive outpatient programs (IOPs)</p>
<p>- Residential treatment facilities</p>
<p>- Crisis hotlines and mobile crisis teams</p>
<ul>
<li>Refer immediately when client presents with:</li>
</ul>
<p>- Suicidal ideation or plan</p>
<p>- Homicidal ideation</p>
<p>- Severe mental health crisis</p>
<p>- Active substance use requiring medical intervention</p>
<p>- Symptoms beyond coaching scope</p>
<p>- Need for diagnosis or treatment</p>
<ul>
<li>Document referrals:</li>
</ul>
<p>- When made</p>
<p>- To whom</p>
<p>- Client response</p>
<p>- Follow-up</p>

<h3>Client Intake Best Practices</h3>

<strong>Screening Questions:</strong>
<p>1. "Are you currently working with a therapist or counselor?"</p>
<p>2. "When did you complete treatment/detox?"</p>
<p>3. "How long have you been in recovery?"</p>
<p>4. "Do you have a psychiatrist or prescriber (if applicable)?"</p>
<p>5. "Are you actively engaged in a recovery program?"</p>
<p>6. "Do you have a relapse prevention plan?"</p>
<p>7. "Who is your emergency contact?"</p>
<p>8. "Do you have suicidal thoughts?" (If yes → immediate clinical referral)</p>

<strong>Required Documentation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Written coaching agreement including:</li>
</ul>
<p>- Statement that coaching is not therapy</p>
<p>- Your credentials and experience</p>
<p>- Scope of coaching services</p>
<p>- Requirement that client maintain clinical support</p>
<p>- Conditions requiring referral/termination</p>
<p>- Confidentiality limits</p>
<p>- Emergency procedures</p>
<ul>

<li>Crisis plan</li>
</ul>

<p>- Accountability</p>
<p>- Goal-setting</p>
<p>- Practical application</p>

<h3>Marketing Best Practices</h3>

<p>"I provide recovery coaching for individuals who have completed treatment and are building their new life in recovery. As someone with lived experience in long-term recovery, I offer peer support, accountability, and practical guidance on applying recovery principles to daily life. Recovery coaching is not therapy, and I require all clients to maintain relationships with licensed clinical providers. Together, we'll work on your recovery goals including [employment, relationships, healthy routines, recovery community connection]."</p>

<em>Social Media:</em>
<p>"Supporting people in recovery through peer mentorship and accountability. If you've completed treatment and are building your recovery life, let's talk about how coaching can support your journey. 🌟 #RecoveryCoaching #PeerSupport #LivedExperience"</p>

<em>Business Card:</em>
<p>"[Name], Recovery Coach</p>
<p>Supporting Your Recovery Journey</p>
<p>Peer Mentorship | Accountability | Life Integration</p>
<p>[Contact] | [Credentials]</p>
<em>Recovery coaching is not therapy or clinical treatment</em>"

<strong>UNSAFE Marketing Language (Avoid):</strong>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<h3>The Ethical Recovery Coach's Commitment</h3>

<p>As a recovery coach, you occupy a unique and valuable role in the recovery ecosystem. You provide something clinical providers cannot: the power of lived experience, peer connection, and recovery community wisdom. But with this role comes significant ethical responsibility.</p>

<strong>Your Commitment:</strong>
<p>1. <strong>Stay in Your Lane:</strong> Provide peer support, not clinical treatment</p>
<p>2. <strong>Protect Your Clients:</strong> Ensure they have robust clinical support</p>
<p>3. <strong>Know When to Refer:</strong> Build and use your referral network actively</p>
<p>4. <strong>Maintain Boundaries:</strong> Between coaching and therapy, between professional and personal</p>
<p>5. <strong>Continue Learning:</strong> Stay current on ethics, regulations, and best practices</p>
<p>6. <strong>Honor Your Recovery:</strong> Model healthy recovery yourself</p>
<p>7. <strong>Build Community:</strong> Connect clients to recovery community and resources</p>

<h3>The Gray Line Is Actually Clear</h3>

<p>While we call it a "gray line," the distinction between recovery coaching and therapy is actually quite clear when you understand it:</p>

<strong>Therapy/Clinical Services:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Diagnosis</li>
<li>Treatment of disorders</li>
<li>Clinical assessment</li>
<li>Treatment planning</li>
<li>Psychotherapy</li>
<li>Medication management</li>
<li>Crisis intervention</li>
</ul>

<strong>Recovery Coaching:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Peer support</li>
<li>Accountability</li>
<li>Goal-setting</li>
<li>Resource connection</li>
<li>Lived experience sharing</li>
<li>Practical life skills</li>
<li>Recovery community connection</li>
<li>Implementation support</li>
</ul>

<strong>The line is crossed when you:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Address the clinical disorder itself (rather than supporting recovery from it)</li>
<li>Make clinical decisions (rather than supporting implementation of clinical decisions)</li>
<li>Treat symptoms (rather than supporting coping strategies)</li>
<li>Diagnose or assess (rather than observe and refer)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Guidance</h3>

<strong>For Every State:</strong>
<p>1. Get trained and certified where available</p>
<p>2. Maintain professional liability insurance</p>
<p>3. Require clients to have clinical support</p>
<p>4. Build referral networks</p>
<p>5. Use clear coaching agreements</p>
<p>6. Market with appropriate language</p>
<p>7. Stay within peer support scope</p>
<p>8. Document appropriately</p>
<p>9. Continue professional development</p>
<p>10. Honor your own recovery</p>

<strong>Remember:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You are valuable and needed</li>
<li>Your lived experience is powerful</li>
<li>Your role is distinct from therapy</li>
<li>You complement clinical care, not replace it</li>
<li>Ethical practice protects everyone</li>
<li>The recovery community needs ethical coaches</li>
</ul>

<strong>When in Doubt:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Refer to clinical provider</li>
<li>Consult with supervisor/mentor</li>
<li>Review your state's requirements</li>
<li>Connect with professional associations</li>
<li>Prioritize client safety</li>
<li>Stay humble about scope</li>
</ul>
