# Case Management: Comprehensive Legal and Certification Guide
## All 50 States + DC

**Document Date:** November 5, 2025
**Purpose:** Complete guide to case management licensing, certification, and requirements across all U.S. jurisdictions

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Key Finding: Case Management is NOT Uniformly Regulated

**Critical Insight:** Unlike professions such as nursing or social work, "case management" itself is **not regulated as a standalone profession** in most states. Instead, regulation typically comes through:

1. **Underlying Professional Licensure** (RN, LCSW, MSW, LPC, etc.)
2. **Voluntary National Certifications** (CCM, ACM, ANCC)
3. **Setting-Specific Requirements** (Medicaid, hospitals, insurance)
4. **State-Specific Certifications** (limited to a few states)

### The Regulatory Landscape

**NO STATE** requires a specific "case manager license" to practice case management independently.

**MOST STATES** require underlying professional licensure if providing case management in healthcare/clinical settings:
- Registered Nurse (RN)
- Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW)
- Licensed Master Social Worker (LMSW)
- Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC)
- Other health/human services licenses

**SOME STATES** have specific case management certifications for certain settings:
- Utah: Behavioral Health Case Management Certificate
- Florida: Certified Behavioral Health Case Manager (CBHCM)
- Texas: Requires CCM or equivalent for certain positions

**22 STATES** participate in Social Work Licensure Compact (enables multi-state practice for LCSWs)

### National Certifications (Voluntary)

**1. CCM (Certified Case Manager)**
- **Issued by:** Commission for Case Manager Certification (CCMC)
- **Status:** Most widely recognized; industry standard
- **Accreditation:** NCCA-accredited
- **Endorsed by:** NASW, Case Management Society of America
- **Cross-setting, cross-discipline**

**2. ACM (Accredited Case Manager)**
- **Issued by:** American Case Management Association
- **Eligibility:** RNs and Social Workers only
- **Focus:** Medical/healthcare case management

**3. ANCC Nursing Case Management Certification (CMGT-BC)**
- **Issued by:** American Nurses Credentialing Center
- **Eligibility:** Registered Nurses only
- **Requires:** Active RN license

### What This Means for Case Managers

**You likely DON'T need a specific "case manager license"**
**You likely DO need:**
- Underlying professional license (RN, LCSW, LPC, etc.) for clinical case management
- CCM or equivalent certification (employer preference or state requirement)
- Bachelor's or Master's degree in social work, nursing, or related field
- Supervised experience hours (varies by certification)

---

## REGULATORY MODELS

### Model 1: Regulation Through Underlying Profession (Most Common)

**How it works:**
- State regulates the underlying profession (nursing, social work, counseling)
- Case management is a function performed by licensed professionals
- No separate case management license exists
- Scope of practice defined by professional license

**Example:**
- Hospital case manager must be RN (regulated by state nursing board)
- Mental health case manager must be LMSW or LPC (regulated by social work/counseling board)
- The "case management" activity is covered under their professional scope

**States using this model:** Most states (40+)

### Model 2: Voluntary Certification Model

**How it works:**
- State doesn't require case management certification
- Employers may require or prefer CCM or equivalent
- Professional advancement and credibility
- May be required for Medicaid billing or certain contracts

**Example:**
- Employer posts job: "RN with CCM certification preferred"
- Insurance company: "Must have CCM to be in our network"
- Hospital: "CCM required for case management supervisor position"

**States using this model:** All states (employer-driven)

### Model 3: State-Specific Certification

**How it works:**
- State creates specific case management certification
- May be required for certain settings (behavioral health, Medicaid)
- Typically in addition to underlying professional license

**States with specific certifications:**
- **Utah:** Behavioral Health Case Management Certificate (effective Jan 2025)
- **Florida:** CBHCM for Medicaid-billable services
- **Texas:** Various positions require certification

### Model 4: Social Work Compact (Interstate Practice)

**How it works:**
- 22 states participate in Social Work Licensure Compact
- LCSWs can practice across state lines (in-person and telehealth)
- Single license, multi-state privilege
- Particularly important for remote/telehealth case management

**Compact States (as of 2025):**
Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington

**Implementation:** 18-24 months after enactment

A: Rarely legally required (exceptions in FL, TX for some roles), but very commonly required or strongly preferred by employers.

A: Social worker is a licensed profession; case management is a function that social workers (and nurses, counselors, etc.) can perform.

2. **Underlying licensure IS required** for clinical case management (RN, LCSW, LPC, etc.)

3. **CCM is the industry standard** certification - Not legally required (except FL Medicaid), but commonly required or preferred by employers

4. **22 states participate in Social Work Compact** - Facilitates multi-state practice for LCSWs

5. **State-specific requirements are rare** - Utah (behavioral health certificate), Florida (CBHCM for Medicaid), Texas (some positions) are exceptions

6. **Education + Experience + Certification** = Competitive case manager

**Recommended Path:**

1. Get bachelor's or master's degree in social work, nursing, or related field
2. Obtain professional licensure (LCSW, RN, LPC, etc.) for clinical settings
3. Gain 12-24 months case management experience
4. Get CCM certification
5. Maintain continuing education
6. Consider state-specific certifications if applicable

**Bottom Line:**
You don't need a "case manager license" because it doesn't exist. You DO need the right combination of education, professional licensure (for clinical work), experience, and certification (CCM) to be competitive in the field.
