**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** NO STATE-MANDATED DEFINITION OR CERTIFICATION

**Finding:** South Dakota does NOT have a state-endorsed certification process for recovery coaches.

**Key Finding:** Completing training programs will NOT make you a "certified recovery coach" in any official South Dakota state capacity, but it is still possible to practice.

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Licensed Professional Framework:**
South Dakota regulates licensed health professionals under Title 36 of South Dakota Codified Laws, but does NOT include recovery coaches in this framework.

**Recovery Coach Status:**
- Recovery coaching is NOT a licensed profession in South Dakota
- No statutory scope of practice found
- **No specific boundary definition** between coaching and licensed practice in state law
- Recovery coaches must be careful not to engage in unauthorized practice of licensed professions (counseling, social work, etc.)

**Key Distinction:** Licensed professionals governed by Title 36; recovery coaches operate outside this framework.

**Comparison with Other States:**
South Dakota represents one extreme of the regulatory spectrum:
- States like Nevada, Ohio, Tennessee: Statutory regulation with mandatory certification and supervision
- States like Pennsylvania, North Dakota: Voluntary certification with independent practice allowed
- **South Dakota**: NO state regulation whatsoever

**For Additional Information:**
- South Dakota Department of Health (general behavioral health information)
- Face It Together (training provider)
- Project Recovery (training provider)
- National certification boards (NAADAC, IC&RC)

**Important Note:** The complete absence of regulation means practitioners bear full responsibility for maintaining ethical standards, defining appropriate scope of practice, and avoiding unauthorized practice of licensed professions. This freedom comes with significant professional and legal responsibility.
