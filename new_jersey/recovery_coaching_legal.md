# New Jersey Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** No specific statutory definition found in New Jersey law.

**Terminology:** New Jersey uses "Certified Peer Recovery Specialist" (CPRS) rather than "recovery coach."

**Regulatory Framework:** Standards for certification of peer recovery specialists are developed and administered by a third-party, non-profit certification provider (Certification Board of NJ).

**Finding:** No explicit legal definition in NJ statutes; operates as a voluntary certification program rather than statutory licensure.

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Scope of Practice:**
- Peer Recovery Specialists provide support and assistance to those in the recovery and community-integration process
- They work in a wide range of settings including community mental health centers, behavioral health programs, substance use treatment facilities, peer-run organizations, emergency rooms, courts, homeless shelters, and outreach programs
- **No specific statutory language found** distinguishing coaching from therapy or defining prohibited activities

**Key Distinction:** CPRS is administered through voluntary certification board, not through state licensing boards that regulate mental health professionals.

**Citation:** Certification Board of NJ standards; NJ Department of Human Services, Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS)

## Legal Citations

**Regulatory Framework:**
- **No specific statute found** governing recovery coaches or peer recovery specialists
- Standards administered by Certification Board of NJ (third-party, non-profit)
- NJ Department of Human Services, Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) oversight

**Related Context:**
- NJ licenses addiction counselors and mental health professionals under separate statutory frameworks
- CPRS certification operates outside of statutory licensure system

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION (not statutory licensure)

**Independent Practice:** PERMITTED - Certified recovery coaches may open their own practice or work in various settings

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** No specific statutory boundary defined; operates under voluntary certification standards rather than professional practice acts

**Key Finding:** New Jersey does NOT regulate recovery coaching through statute. It operates as a voluntary certification system administered by the Certification Board of NJ with standards developed in coordination with DMHAS. Once certified, recovery coaches CAN practice independently.

**Important Distinction:** This is fundamentally different from licensed mental health professionals or addiction counselors who are subject to statutory licensing requirements and scope of practice restrictions.

**Recommendation:** While independent practice is permitted, recovery coaches should:
1. Maintain clear boundaries regarding clinical services
2. Adhere to ethical standards of certification body
3. Be aware of scope limitations compared to licensed professionals
4. Consider professional liability insurance
