# Wisconsin Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** DEFINED IN ADMINISTRATIVE CODE

**Legal Definition:** Wisconsin Administrative Code DHS 75.03(76) defines a recovery coach as "an individual that works with and supports individuals receiving substance use services and may be included in the treatment plan to assist with engagement in treatment services or recovery systems, or both."

**Key Distinction:** Recovery coaches are **NOT** considered clinical staff as defined in DHS 75.03(17) and **CANNOT** provide clinical services as defined in DHS 75.03(16).

**Citation:** Wisconsin Administrative Code § DHS 75.03(76); § DHS 75.03(17); § DHS 75.03(16)

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Explicit Regulatory Distinction:**

**Recovery Coaches:**
- NOT clinical staff
- CANNOT provide clinical services
- Work with and support individuals receiving substance use services
- May be included in treatment plan for engagement support

**Clinical Staff (DHS 75.03(17)):**
- Defined separately in administrative code
- Authorized to provide clinical services
- Include licensed professionals and qualified treatment staff

**Licensed Professionals in Wisconsin:**
Wisconsin regulates licensed professionals including:
- Licensed Professional Counselors (LPC)
- Licensed Clinical Social Workers
- Marriage and Family Therapists
- Substance Abuse Counselors (regulated under Wis. Stat. § 440.88)

**Key Finding:** Wisconsin Administrative Code creates CLEAR DISTINCTION between recovery coaches (non-clinical) and clinical staff.

**Citation:** Wis. Admin. Code § DHS 75.03 (definitions); Wis. Stat. § 440.88 (substance abuse counselors); Wis. Stat. Chapter 457 (other licensed professionals)

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Regulatory Framework:**
- Recovery coaches work within substance use treatment programs certified under Wisconsin Administrative Code Chapter DHS 75 (Community Substance Use Service Standards)
- Providers of outpatient services certified under Wis. Admin. Code ch. DHS 75

**Supervision Requirements:**
- Services must have written policies and procedures for provision of clinical supervision to:
  - Unlicensed staff
  - Qualified treatment trainees
  - **Recovery support staff** (includes recovery coaches)
- Recovery coaches fall under category of recovery support staff requiring supervision

**Independent Practice Status:**
- **MIXED FINDINGS:**
  - Administrative code suggests recovery coaches work within certified substance use treatment programs with supervision
  - However, some sources indicate "employment opportunities for certified recovery coaches span from independent practice to collaborative roles in healthcare teams"
  - Recovery coaches can "command fees up to $150 hourly" in private practice

**Key Consideration:** Since recovery coaches are NOT clinical staff and CANNOT provide clinical services, "independent practice" would be limited to non-clinical support services only.

**Certification:**
- **No specific state certification requirement found** for recovery coaches in Wisconsin statutes or administrative code
- Voluntary certification may be available through national organizations
- For work within DHS 75-certified programs, must follow program policies

**Citation:** Wis. Admin. Code ch. DHS 75 (Community Substance Use Service Standards); substance use service provider certification requirements

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** DEFINED IN ADMINISTRATIVE CODE but no state certification required

**Independent Practice:** UNCLEAR - May be permitted for non-clinical services but administrative code suggests work within certified programs with supervision

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** EXPLICIT DISTINCTION - Recovery coaches are NOT clinical staff and CANNOT provide clinical services

**Key Finding:** Wisconsin creates a clear regulatory distinction between recovery coaches (non-clinical support staff requiring supervision within substance use programs) and clinical staff. Recovery coaches are defined in administrative code but do not appear to have mandatory state certification requirements.

**Critical Regulatory Framework:**

**What Recovery Coaches ARE:**
- Non-clinical support staff
- Individuals who work with and support those receiving substance use services
- May be included in treatment plans for engagement support
- Subject to supervision requirements when working in DHS 75-certified programs

**What Recovery Coaches ARE NOT:**
- Clinical staff
- Authorized to provide clinical services
- Subject to professional licensure under Wis. Stat. § 440.88 or Chapter 457

**Wisconsin's Unique Approach:**
- Defines recovery coaches in administrative code (DHS 75)
- Explicitly excludes recovery coaches from clinical staff category
- Creates supervision requirement for recovery support staff
- Does NOT appear to require state certification
- Allows some flexibility while maintaining clear non-clinical boundary

**Practical Implications:**

**Within DHS 75-Certified Programs:**
1. ✓ Must follow written supervision policies
2. ✓ Classified as recovery support staff
3. ✓ Cannot provide clinical services
4. ✓ Support engagement in treatment/recovery systems
5. ✓ May be included in treatment plans (non-clinical role)

**Potential Independent Practice (needs clarification):**
1. ? May be possible for non-clinical support services
2. ? Must maintain clear non-clinical boundaries
3. ? Should not hold out as providing substance use treatment
4. ? Consider professional liability insurance
5. ? Develop clear service agreements defining non-clinical nature

**Supervision Context:**
- Required when working as recovery support staff in certified programs
- Supervision focuses on recovery support functions, not clinical practice
- Organizations must have written policies for supervision

**Comparison with Licensed Professionals:**
- **Licensed Substance Abuse Counselors (Wis. Stat. § 440.88):** Can provide clinical services, subject to professional licensing
- **Recovery Coaches:** Non-clinical support, not professionally licensed, cannot provide clinical services

**Wisconsin's Position on Regulatory Spectrum:**
- **More Defined Than:** Oregon, Washington, South Carolina (no regulation found)
- **Less Restrictive Than:** Tennessee, Ohio (explicit organizational employment mandates)
- **Unique Feature:** Defines recovery coaches in administrative code but doesn't require state certification

**Recommendations:**

1. **For Work Within DHS 75-Certified Programs:**
   - Understand you are classified as recovery support staff
   - Follow organizational supervision policies
   - Maintain clear non-clinical role
   - Do not provide clinical services
   - Support treatment engagement within defined scope

2. **For Potential Independent Practice:**
   - **Consult attorney** about permissibility given administrative code framework
   - Obtain professional liability insurance
   - Develop clear service agreements stating:
     - Non-clinical nature of services
     - Not providing substance use treatment
     - Scope limited to recovery support/coaching
   - Consider voluntary national certification for credibility
   - Establish referral relationships with licensed professionals
   - Be prepared to explain distinction from clinical services

3. **Maintain Clear Boundaries:**
   - Do NOT assess, diagnose, or treat substance use disorders
   - Do NOT develop clinical treatment plans
   - Do NOT provide counseling or therapy
   - DO provide peer support, encouragement, recovery navigation
   - DO assist with engagement in treatment/recovery systems
   - DO refer to licensed professionals for clinical needs

4. **Business Considerations (if independent practice attempted):**
   - Form LLC for liability protection
   - Obtain general business license if required
   - Get professional liability insurance (essential)
   - Clear marketing that avoids clinical terminology
   - Documentation that reflects non-clinical support
   - Ongoing education in ethics and boundaries

**Critical Questions Needing Clarification:**
1. Can recovery coaches practice independently outside DHS 75-certified programs?
2. Does independent practice require any state registration or notification?
3. What are the exact scope boundaries for private-pay recovery coaching services?

**For More Information:**
- Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS)
- DHS Substance Abuse Treatment Program Certification
- Review full Wis. Admin. Code ch. DHS 75
- Consult attorney familiar with Wisconsin health care law
- Consider contacting DHS for guidance on independent practice question

**Important Note:** Wisconsin's administrative code defines recovery coaches and establishes their non-clinical status, but the question of independent practice outside certified programs remains somewhat unclear. Anyone considering independent recovery coaching practice in Wisconsin should seek legal guidance to ensure compliance with DHS 75 and other applicable regulations.
