# New Mexico Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** DEFINED IN ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS

**Legal Definitions:**

1. **Certified Peer Support Worker (CPSW):** Peer support workers who have successfully completed training with the behavioral health service division's office of peer recovery and engagement (OPRE) and have obtained certification from the New Mexico credentialing board of behavioral health professionals.

2. **Peer Support Workers (PSW):** Individuals who have been successful in their own recovery from substance use disorder who help other individuals in their recovery process through shared understanding, respect, and mutual empowerment, reducing the likelihood of relapse.

**Citation:** New Mexico Administrative Code § 8.321.2.42 (Peer Support Services); § 8.325.12.7 (Definitions)

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Scope of Practice:**
- Peer support workers are NOT independent practitioners
- They provide peer-based support services, not clinical treatment
- Must operate within the context of a comprehensive, individualized plan of care

**Key Distinction:** Peer support workers are clearly distinguished from licensed clinical mental health counselors (LPCC) and licensed professional art therapists (LPAT) who may practice independently without supervision once licensed.

**Citation:** NM Admin. Code § 8.321.2.42; New Mexico Counseling and Therapy Practice Board regulations (Title 16, Chapter 27, NMAC)

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Eligibility:**
- Must be self-identified consumers who are in recovery from mental illness or substance use disorder
- Must be supervised by an independent practitioner or someone trained and certified to supervise peers
- Services must be coordinated within the context of a comprehensive, individualized plan of care with specific individualized goals

**CRITICAL LIMITATION - NO INDEPENDENT PRACTICE:**
**Recovery coaches/peer support workers in New Mexico do NOT have independent practice authority. They MUST work under supervision.**

**Supervision Requirements:**
- Must be supervised by an independent practitioner OR
- Someone trained and certified to supervise peers
- Services must be reimbursable only when provided under proper supervision

**Contrast with Licensed Professionals:**
Licensed professional clinical mental health counselors (LPCC) or licensed professional art therapists (LPAT) may practice independently without supervision once they acquire their official license. This is explicitly NOT the case for peer support workers/recovery coaches.

**Citation:** NM Admin. Code § 8.321.2.42; § 16.27.9.8 (Supervision requirements)

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** STATE CERTIFICATION REQUIRED through administrative code

**Independent Practice:** EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED - Must work under supervision

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** Clear distinction; peer support workers provide non-clinical support under supervision, while licensed professionals can practice independently

**Key Finding:** New Mexico has clear administrative regulations that:
1. Define peer support worker certification
2. REQUIRE supervision by independent practitioner or certified supervisor
3. PROHIBIT independent practice for peer support workers/recovery coaches
4. Distinguish peer support from licensed clinical practice

**Critical Limitation:** Unlike some states where recovery coaching operates in an unregulated space, New Mexico EXPLICITLY REQUIRES supervision and prohibits independent autonomous practice for peer support workers/recovery coaches.

**Comparison:** This contrasts sharply with licensed clinical mental health counselors who CAN practice independently after full licensure in New Mexico.
