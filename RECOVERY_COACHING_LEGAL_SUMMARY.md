**General Pattern Across States:**

## Key Legal Themes

### 1. Licensing vs. Certification
- **Only 3 states require licensure:** Massachusetts (2025), Montana, Florida (with grace period)
- **Most states use voluntary certification** that becomes mandatory for certain employment settings

### 2. Independent Practice
- **Explicitly prohibited:** Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi (must work in designated systems/under supervision)
- **Requires supervision:** Montana, Hawaii, most states with certification programs
- **Unregulated (not prohibited):** Alaska, Arizona, California, and states without specific regulations

### 3. Scope of Practice Boundaries
**Universal themes across states:**
- Cannot diagnose mental health/substance use disorders
- Cannot prescribe medication or treatment plans
- Cannot provide therapy or clinical treatment
- Must not hold out as licensed professional
- Provide peer support, not clinical services
- Share lived experience and recovery journey
- Assist with goal-setting and resource navigation

### 4. Terminology Matters
- "Recovery Coach" - often unregulated
- "Peer Recovery Specialist" - usually requires certification
- "Peer Support Specialist" - typically state-defined and certified
- "Recovery Support Specialist" - varies by state

### 5. Interventionists
**NO SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOUND** in this research about interventionists having different rules than recovery coaches. This would require separate research.

## Recommendations for Practice

### For Recovery Coaches Operating in Multiple States:
1. **Research specific state requirements** - cannot assume reciprocity
2. **Understand the distinction** between unregulated coaching and certified peer support roles
3. **Know the therapy boundary** - if you're treating mental health conditions, you need a license
4. **Document your scope** - keep clear records of what services you provide
5. **Consider IC&RC certification** - provides most portability across states

### For Those Seeking Independent Practice:
**States with fewest restrictions:**
- Alaska, Arizona, California - no specific recovery coach regulations
- However, must still avoid practicing mental health therapy without a license

**States requiring employment in specific settings:**
- Iowa - must work through licensed agency with IDPH contract
- Mississippi - must be employed in state mental health system
- Kentucky - requires professional supervision

### Red Flags (Likely Unlicensed Practice of Mental Health):
- Marketing yourself as providing "therapy" or "counseling"
- Diagnosing mental health or substance use disorders
- Creating treatment plans
- Using clinical assessment tools
- Billing insurance as a mental health provider (without credentials)
