## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** STATE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM (not statutory licensure)

**Independent Practice:** PERMITTED - Recovery coaches can operate their own private practice

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** Recovery coaches explicitly distinguished from therapists and mental health professionals; not subject to clinical licensure requirements

**Key Finding:** North Dakota recognizes recovery coaches through a state certification system that allows for independent practice. Recovery coaches can establish private practices and set their own fees, operating outside the statutory licensing framework that governs addiction counselors and mental health professionals.

**Important Distinctions:**
1. Recovery coaches ≠ Licensed Addiction Counselors (LAC)
2. Recovery coaches ≠ Master Addiction Counselors (MAC)
3. Recovery coaches ≠ Therapists or mental health professionals
4. Based on lived experience, not clinical training

**Practical Considerations for Independent Practice:**
1. Maintain clear documentation of non-clinical services
2. Adhere to peer support Code of Ethics
3. Maintain certification through biennial renewal
4. Complete required continuing education (20 hours every 2 years)
5. Establish appropriate referral relationships with licensed professionals
6. Consider professional liability insurance
7. Clearly communicate scope of services to clients

**Recommendation:** While independent practice is permitted, recovery coaches should maintain clear boundaries regarding clinical services and establish protocols for referring clients to licensed professionals when clinical needs arise.
