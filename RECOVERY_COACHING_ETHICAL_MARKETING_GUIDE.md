## Per-State Guide for Navigating the Gray Line

**Document Date:** November 5, 2025
**Purpose:** To help recovery coaches market their practices ethically and legally while serving clients in the critical post-rehab integration phase

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Gray Line: Recovery Coaching vs. Therapy

**Who This Guide Is For:**
Recovery coaches who work with individuals who are:
- Out of active rehab/treatment
- In recovery (not actively using)
- Need support integrating recovery tools into daily life
- Require accountability and peer support
- Benefit from someone with lived experience

**The Critical Distinction:**
- **Recovery Coaching:** Peer support, accountability, goal-setting, resource connection, sharing lived experience
- **Therapy/Counseling:** Diagnosis, treatment of mental health/substance use disorders, psychotherapy, clinical treatment

### Universal Ethical Requirements for Recovery Coaches

Regardless of state, ethical recovery coaches should:

1. **Ensure Client Has Therapy Support**
   - Client must be working with (or have access to) a licensed therapist or counselor
   - Recovery coaching complements therapy; it does not replace it
   - For clients with substance use disorder history, ongoing clinical support is essential

2. **Verify Client Is In Recovery**
   - Client should be out of acute treatment phase
   - Should have established sobriety/recovery (timeframe varies by approach)
   - Should have clinical support system in place
   - Active users in crisis need clinical intervention, not coaching

3. **Make Outbound Referrals**
   - Maintain referral network of licensed professionals
   - Refer immediately when client presents with:
     - Suicidal ideation
     - Active substance use relapse requiring medical intervention
     - Severe mental health crisis
     - Symptoms beyond coaching scope
   - Document referrals appropriately

4. **Clear Scope Definition**
   - Use coaching language, not clinical language
   - Clearly state you are not a therapist
   - Written agreements defining scope of support
   - Transparency about your lived experience and training

### Marketing Language Framework

**SAFE Recovery Coaching Language:**
- "Supporting your recovery journey"
- "Peer support from someone with lived experience"
- "Accountability and goal-setting for sustainable recovery"
- "Helping you integrate recovery tools into daily life"
- "Recovery planning and resource connection"
- "Post-rehab life integration support"

**AVOID - Crosses Into Therapy:**
- "Treating addiction" or "treating mental health conditions"
- "Diagnosing substance use disorders"
- "Therapy for addiction"
- "Counseling services"
- "Clinical treatment"
- "Curing" or "fixing" your addiction

**Marketing Guidelines:**

✅ **YOU CAN SAY:**
- "Certified Recovery Support Specialist providing peer support"

- "Accountability partner for your recovery journey"
- "Connecting you to community recovery resources"

❌ **DO NOT SAY:**

**Ethical Requirements:**

1. **Therapist Relationship:**

   - Get client's signed release to coordinate (but maintain appropriate boundaries)

2. **Recovery Verification:**
   - Client should be out of acute treatment phase
   - If pursuing CRSS: you need 2 years recovery; model this standard

- If you're treating the underlying disorder = therapy (need license)

**Practical Guidance:**
- Consider getting CRSS certification even for private practice (credibility)

## UNIVERSAL ETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR ALL STATES

### The Three Non-Negotiables

**1. CLIENT MUST HAVE THERAPIST**
- Before engaging in recovery coaching, verify client has:
  - Licensed therapist or counselor
  - Psychiatrist (if medication management needed)
  - Clinical addiction specialist
- If client doesn't have clinical support:
  - FIRST step is referral to appropriate licensed provider
  - Do not begin coaching until clinical relationship established
  - This protects both you and client

**2. CLIENT MUST BE IN RECOVERY**
- Client should be:
  - Out of acute treatment/detox phase
  - Established in recovery (timeframe varies but generally stable)
  - Not actively using without medical supervision
  - Connected to recovery support (12-step, SMART Recovery, etc.)
- Active users in crisis need clinical intervention, not coaching
- If client relapses during coaching:
  - Immediately connect with clinical provider
  - May need to pause coaching until stabilized
  - Clinical team handles crisis, not you

**3. YOU MUST MAKE OUTBOUND REFERRALS**
- Maintain robust referral network:
  - Licensed professional counselors (LPCs/LCPCs)
  - Licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs)
  - Licensed marriage and family therapists (LMFTs)
  - Psychiatrists for medication management
  - Intensive outpatient programs (IOPs)
  - Residential treatment facilities
  - Crisis hotlines and mobile crisis teams
- Refer immediately when client presents with:
  - Suicidal ideation or plan
  - Homicidal ideation
  - Severe mental health crisis
  - Active substance use requiring medical intervention
  - Symptoms beyond coaching scope
  - Need for diagnosis or treatment
- Document referrals:
  - When made
  - To whom
  - Client response
  - Follow-up

### Client Intake Best Practices

**Screening Questions:**
1. "Are you currently working with a therapist or counselor?"
2. "When did you complete treatment/detox?"
3. "How long have you been in recovery?"
4. "Do you have a psychiatrist or prescriber (if applicable)?"
5. "Are you actively engaged in a recovery program?"
6. "Do you have a relapse prevention plan?"
7. "Who is your emergency contact?"
8. "Do you have suicidal thoughts?" (If yes → immediate clinical referral)

**Required Documentation:**
- Written coaching agreement including:
  - Statement that coaching is not therapy
  - Your credentials and experience
  - Scope of coaching services
  - Requirement that client maintain clinical support
  - Conditions requiring referral/termination
  - Confidentiality limits
  - Emergency procedures
- Release of information (ROI) to coordinate with therapist (optional but recommended)
- Emergency contact information
- Crisis plan

### What Recovery Coaching IS

**Appropriate Recovery Coaching Activities:**
- Sharing your lived experience in recovery
- Providing accountability for recovery goals
- Supporting implementation of treatment plan (created by clinician)
- Helping client apply recovery principles to daily life
- Assisting with goal-setting around recovery-related life areas:
  - Employment/career
  - Relationships
  - Family dynamics
  - Healthy routines and structure
  - Recovery community connection
- Supporting attendance at recovery meetings
- Celebrating milestones and successes
- Providing hope and inspiration through your journey
- Helping navigate practical challenges:
  - Housing
  - Transportation
  - Community resources
  - Recovery-focused activities
- Peer mentorship and support
- Being available for check-ins and support calls
- Helping identify triggers and practice coping skills (from treatment plan)

### What Recovery Coaching IS NOT

**NOT Recovery Coaching (Requires License):**
- Diagnosing substance use disorders
- Diagnosing co-occurring mental health conditions
- Creating treatment plans
- Modifying medication
- Providing psychotherapy or counseling
- Conducting clinical assessments
- Treating underlying mental health conditions
- Treating trauma
- Managing psychiatric crises
- Determining level of care needed
- Making clinical decisions
- Billing insurance as mental health provider
- Using clinical assessment tools
- Interpreting psychological tests
- Providing couples therapy
- Providing family therapy (unless certified for family peer support)

### The Integration Model: Coaching + Therapy

**Best Practice Structure:**

```
CLIENT
   |
   |-- THERAPIST/CLINICAL PROVIDER (addresses clinical needs)
   |     - Diagnosis
   |     - Treatment planning
   |     - Clinical interventions
   |     - Medication management (with psychiatrist)
   |     - Crisis management
   |
   |-- RECOVERY COACH (supports implementation)
         - Peer support
         - Accountability
         - Goal-setting
         - Practical application
         - Resource connection
         - Lived experience sharing
```

**Communication Model:**
- With client permission (ROI), communicate with therapist about:
  - Client progress on goals
  - Observations of challenges
  - Need for additional support
  - Successful strategies
- Do NOT:
  - Make clinical recommendations
  - Question diagnosis or treatment plan
  - Undermine therapist relationship
  - Present yourself as equal clinical provider

### Marketing Best Practices

**SAFE Marketing Language Examples:**

*Website Copy:*
"I provide recovery coaching for individuals who have completed treatment and are building their new life in recovery. As someone with lived experience in long-term recovery, I offer peer support, accountability, and practical guidance on applying recovery principles to daily life. Recovery coaching is not therapy, and I require all clients to maintain relationships with licensed clinical providers. Together, we'll work on your recovery goals including [employment, relationships, healthy routines, recovery community connection]."

*Social Media:*
"Supporting people in recovery through peer mentorship and accountability. If you've completed treatment and are building your recovery life, let's talk about how coaching can support your journey. 🌟 #RecoveryCoaching #PeerSupport #LivedExperience"

*Business Card:*
"[Name], Recovery Coach
Supporting Your Recovery Journey
Peer Mentorship | Accountability | Life Integration
[Contact] | [Credentials]
*Recovery coaching is not therapy or clinical treatment*"

**UNSAFE Marketing Language (Avoid):**

❌ "Treating addiction and co-occurring disorders"
❌ "Therapy for substance use"
❌ "Clinical recovery services"
❌ "Diagnosing and treating your addiction"
❌ "Better than therapy"
❌ "You don't need a therapist, just a coach"
❌ "Counseling for addiction"
❌ "I can cure your addiction"

### Red Flags: When to Refuse/Refer a Client

7. Client expects you to diagnose or treat mental health conditions
8. Client wants you to prescribe/modify medication
9. Client is not in recovery (still actively using)
10. You don't have adequate referral network in client's area

**Immediate Referral Situations:**

## CONCLUSION

### The Ethical Recovery Coach's Commitment

As a recovery coach, you occupy a unique and valuable role in the recovery ecosystem. You provide something clinical providers cannot: the power of lived experience, peer connection, and recovery community wisdom. But with this role comes significant ethical responsibility.

**Your Commitment:**
1. **Stay in Your Lane:** Provide peer support, not clinical treatment
2. **Protect Your Clients:** Ensure they have robust clinical support
3. **Know When to Refer:** Build and use your referral network actively
4. **Maintain Boundaries:** Between coaching and therapy, between professional and personal
5. **Continue Learning:** Stay current on ethics, regulations, and best practices
6. **Honor Your Recovery:** Model healthy recovery yourself
7. **Build Community:** Connect clients to recovery community and resources

### The Gray Line Is Actually Clear

While we call it a "gray line," the distinction between recovery coaching and therapy is actually quite clear when you understand it:

**Therapy/Clinical Services:**
- Diagnosis
- Treatment of disorders
- Clinical assessment
- Treatment planning
- Psychotherapy
- Medication management
- Crisis intervention

**Recovery Coaching:**
- Peer support
- Accountability
- Goal-setting
- Resource connection
- Lived experience sharing
- Practical life skills
- Recovery community connection
- Implementation support

**The line is crossed when you:**
- Address the clinical disorder itself (rather than supporting recovery from it)
- Make clinical decisions (rather than supporting implementation of clinical decisions)
- Treat symptoms (rather than supporting coping strategies)
- Diagnose or assess (rather than observe and refer)

### Final Guidance

**For Every State:**
1. Get trained and certified where available
2. Maintain professional liability insurance
3. Require clients to have clinical support
4. Build referral networks
5. Use clear coaching agreements
6. Market with appropriate language
7. Stay within peer support scope
8. Document appropriately
9. Continue professional development
10. Honor your own recovery

**Remember:**
- You are valuable and needed
- Your lived experience is powerful
- Your role is distinct from therapy
- You complement clinical care, not replace it
- Ethical practice protects everyone
- The recovery community needs ethical coaches

**When in Doubt:**
- Refer to clinical provider
- Consult with supervisor/mentor
- Review your state's requirements
- Connect with professional associations
- Prioritize client safety
- Stay humble about scope
