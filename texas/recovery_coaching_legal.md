# Texas Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** Defined through certification board (not statute)

**Terminology:** Texas recognizes two related certifications for recovery coaches:
1. **Peer Recovery Specialist (PRS)**
2. **Recovery Support Peer Specialist (RSPS)**

**Certification Authority:** Texas Certification Board of Addiction Professionals (TCBAP)

**Key Characteristic:** Recovery coaches provide peer-based support based on lived experience, distinct from licensed clinical professionals.

**Citation:** Texas Certification Board of Addiction Professionals Board (TCBAP) standards

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Licensed Professional Framework:**
Texas extensively regulates licensed behavioral health professionals including:
- Licensed Professional Counselors (LPC) - governed by Texas Administrative Code Title 22
- Licensed Clinical Social Workers
- Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists
- These professionals governed by Texas Behavioral Health Executive Council (BHEC)

**Recovery Coach Status:**
- Certified through TCBAP (separate from state licensing boards)
- Provide peer support based on lived experience
- **NOT** licensed clinicians
- **NO specific statutory language found** defining exact boundary between coaching and therapy

**Key Distinction:**
- Licensed professionals (LPC, etc.) require graduate education, clinical training, supervision, and licensure
- Recovery coaches require lived experience, training, and voluntary certification through TCBAP

**Citation:** Texas Administrative Code Title 22 (licensed professionals); TCBAP standards (recovery coaches)

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Certification Requirements (PRS/RSPS):**
- Verification of at least 46 education hours specific to PRS domains:
  - 10 hours in Advocacy domain
  - 10 hours in Mentoring/Education domain
  - 10 hours in Recovery Support domain
  - 16 hours in Ethical Responsibility domain
- Training must adhere to standards and requirements established by TCBAP
- Pass examination (for RSPS typically requires IC&RC or national certification exam)

**Independent Practice Status:**
- **PERMITTED** - Employment opportunities for certified recovery coaches span from independent practice to collaborative roles in healthcare teams
- Recovery coaches operating their own private practice can command fees up to $150 hourly
- **No explicit prohibition on independent practice found**

**Contrast with Licensed Professionals:**
- Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) Associates in Texas must work under supervision and cannot practice independently
- Recovery coaches (PRS/RSPS) CAN practice independently once certified
- Different regulatory framework allows different practice structures

**Citation:** TCBAP certification requirements; Texas Department of State Health Services recovery resources

## Legal Citations

**Statutory Framework:**
- **No specific statute found** governing recovery coaches in Texas statutes
- Licensed behavioral health professionals governed by Texas Occupations Code and Administrative Code Title 22
- Recovery coaches operate under voluntary certification system

**Certification Authority:**
- **Texas Certification Board of Addiction Professionals (TCBAP)** - third-party certification board
- Establishes standards and requirements for PRS/RSPS certification

**Regulatory Bodies (for comparison):**
- Texas Behavioral Health Executive Council (BHEC) - governs licensed professionals, NOT recovery coaches
- Texas Department of State Health Services - general behavioral health oversight

**Related Regulations:**
- Texas Administrative Code Title 22 - Licensed professional counselors and therapists (separate framework)
- Recovery coaches NOT governed by these professional practice acts

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION through TCBAP (not statutory licensure)

**Independent Practice:** PERMITTED - Recovery coaches can operate independent private practice

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** Recovery coaches certified through separate system from licensed professionals; boundaries not explicitly defined in statute but implied through different certification frameworks
