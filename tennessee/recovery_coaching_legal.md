## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** STATE CERTIFICATION REQUIRED through TDMHSAS

**Independent Practice:** EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED - Cannot provide services as private practice, from home/office, or for independent pay

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** Clear distinction; CPRS provide peer support under supervision, not clinical services

**Key Finding:** Tennessee is one of the MOST RESTRICTIVE states for recovery coach practice. The state EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS independent practice and requires:
1. Employment by TDMHSAS-licensed agency
2. Direct clinical supervision by licensed professional
3. All billing through employer (no individual billing)
4. Cannot provide services from home or own office

**Critical Restrictions:**

**What CPRS CANNOT Do in Tennessee:**
1. ❌ Operate private practice
2. ❌ Provide services from home or personal office
3. ❌ Offer services independently for pay
4. ❌ Bill insurance/Medicaid directly
5. ❌ Work without direct clinical supervision
6. ❌ Seek reimbursement from health plans as individual
7. ❌ Practice outside of TDMHSAS-licensed agency

**What CPRS MUST Do in Tennessee:**
1. ✓ Work for TDMHSAS-licensed agency
2. ✓ Maintain certification through state
3. ✓ Work under direct clinical supervision
4. ✓ Let employer handle all billing
5. ✓ Complete continuing education annually
6. ✓ Adhere to Code of Ethics
7. ✓ Maintain 2+ years recovery before certification
8. ✓ Operate within agency structure only

**Comparison with Other States:**
- **Most Permissive** (South Dakota, Pennsylvania, North Dakota): Independent practice allowed
- **Moderate** (Nevada, Rhode Island): Organizational affiliation suggested but not explicitly prohibited
- **MOST RESTRICTIVE** (Tennessee, Ohio, New Mexico, West Virginia): Explicit prohibition on independent practice

**Why Tennessee is So Restrictive:**
1. Explicit Code of Ethics prohibition on private practice
2. State regulation specifying agency employment requirement
3. Supervision requirement under licensed professional
4. No individual billing permitted
5. Must practice within licensed agency structure

**For Aspiring Recovery Coaches in Tennessee:**

**Path to Practice:**
1. Meet 2-year recovery requirement
2. Complete 40 hours of training
3. Obtain certification from TDMHSAS
4. Seek employment with TDMHSAS-licensed agency

The only legal path is employment through a TDMHSAS-licensed agency with proper supervision.
