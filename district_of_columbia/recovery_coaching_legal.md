# District of Columbia Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** Defined through administrative regulations

**Definition:** Peer Specialists (which includes recovery coaches) are self-identified people who are successful in the recovery process and use their experience to support others with similar experiences. Through mutual respect and shared understanding based on similar experiences, they help people get into treatment, navigate aspects of the system of care and identify community resources necessary to make informed choices about their individual journeys of wellness and paths to recovery.

**Terminology:** DC uses "Peer Specialist" and recognizes "Recovery Coaching and Mentoring" as related services.

**Key Characteristic:** Based on lived experience and successful recovery journey.

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Certification Requirements:**
- Certification must be approved by District of Columbia's Department of Health
- Most certification programs require:
  - Minimum of high school education or equivalent (no further education required)
  - Personal experience with recovery
- Must pass certification exam after training to demonstrate knowledge and skills
- Peer Specialist Certification Training Program provides core curriculum, training and instruction required to obtain DBH's Peer Specialist Certification

**Supervision Requirements:**
A qualified practitioner provides clinical and administrative supervision to a Certified Peer Specialist.

**Qualified Practitioners Include:**
- Psychiatrists
- Psychologists
- Independent clinical social workers
- Advanced practice registered nurses
- Registered nurses
- Licensed professional counselors
- Independent social workers
- Addiction counselors

**CRITICAL FINDING - SUPERVISION REQUIRED:**
The supervision requirement suggests that certified peer specialists in DC work under the supervision of qualified practitioners, which may limit fully independent practice.

**Independent Practice Status:**
- **UNCLEAR but LIKELY RESTRICTED** - Supervision requirement indicates organizational affiliation model
- Search results indicate "recovery coaches can find employment in a variety of settings, including private practices, rehabilitation centers, government agencies, and non-profit organizations"
- However, supervision by qualified practitioner requirement suggests employment or contracted relationship with supervising entity
- **Full independent private practice without supervision appears unlikely under current framework**

**Regulatory Framework:**
- DC Municipal Regulations (DCMR) Title 22 (Health) contains regulations on:
  - **Chapter 22-A73:** Department of Mental Health Peer Specialist Certification
  - **Chapter 22-A63:** Certification Standards for Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Providers
