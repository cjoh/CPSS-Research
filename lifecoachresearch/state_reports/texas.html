    <h1>Texas - Life Coach Legal Requirements</h1>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> Life coaches do NOT require licensing in Texas. However, coaches must maintain clear boundaries with clinical mental health practice.</p>
        <p><strong>Critical Distinction:</strong> Life coaching focuses on goal-setting, motivation, and personal development. Coaches may NOT diagnose or treat mental health conditions or use protected clinical titles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert-box">
        <h4>Texas-Specific Alert</h4>
        <p>The Texas Behavioral Health Executive Council (BHEC) has issued consumer warnings about unlicensed practice and actively investigates complaints. Life coaches must maintain exceptionally clear boundaries and documentation distinguishing their services from licensed mental health practice.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Legal Definition</h2>
    <p>Texas does not provide a statutory definition of "life coach" as it is not a regulated profession. Life coaching is generally understood as a professional relationship focused on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Goal setting and achievement</li>
        <li>Personal and professional development</li>
        <li>Accountability and motivation</li>
        <li>Performance enhancement</li>
        <li>Career guidance and transitions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <p><strong>No licensing required.</strong> Texas does not regulate life coaching as a profession. Life coaches may practice without state-issued licenses, certifications, or registrations.</p>

    <p>However, many coaches voluntarily obtain certification through professional organizations such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>International Coaching Federation (ICF)</li>
        <li>Center for Credentialing & Education (CCE)</li>
        <li>International Association of Coaching (IAC)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practice Regulations</h2>
    <p>While life coaching itself is unregulated, coaches must comply with general business regulations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Business registration with the Texas Secretary of State (if operating as LLC, corporation, etc.)</li>
        <li>Assumed name certificate (if using DBA)</li>
        <li>General liability insurance (recommended but not required)</li>
        <li>Compliance with Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act</li>
        <li>Adherence to ethical standards (if certified through professional organization)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Boundaries with Clinical Professionals</h2>
    <p>Texas strictly regulates mental health professionals through the Behavioral Health Executive Council (BHEC). Life coaches must NOT:</p>

    <h4>Prohibited Activities</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Diagnose mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc.)</li>
        <li>Provide psychotherapy or clinical counseling</li>
        <li>Treat mental illness or psychological disorders</li>
        <li>Prescribe medication or recommend specific medical treatments</li>
        <li>Hold themselves out as psychologists, therapists, or counselors</li>
        <li>Use protected titles without proper licensure</li>
        <li>Represent services in a way that implies clinical expertise</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Restrictions & Prohibitions</h2>

    <h3>Protected Titles</h3>
    <p>Under Texas law, the following titles are protected and may NOT be used without proper licensure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Psychologist (Tex. Occ. Code § 501.003)</li>
        <li>Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) (Tex. Occ. Code § 503.001 et seq.)</li>
        <li>Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) (Tex. Occ. Code § 505.001 et seq.)</li>
        <li>Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT) (Tex. Occ. Code § 502.001 et seq.)</li>
        <li>Licensed Professional Counselor Intern (LPC-Intern)</li>
        <li>Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Associate (LMFT-Associate)</li>
        <li>Mental Health Counselor</li>
        <li>Therapist (when implying clinical practice)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>BHEC Enforcement Actions</h3>
    <p>The Texas Behavioral Health Executive Council actively:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Investigates complaints of unlicensed practice</li>
        <li>Issues consumer alerts about individuals practicing without licenses</li>
        <li>Publishes enforcement actions and disciplinary orders</li>
        <li>Coordinates with law enforcement on unauthorized practice cases</li>
        <li>Monitors advertising and marketing materials for misleading claims</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scope of Practice Limitations</h3>
    <p>Life coaches must clearly distinguish their services from clinical mental health treatment. When a client presents with mental health concerns, coaches should:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Immediately refer to licensed mental health professionals</li>
        <li>Decline to work with clients beyond their scope</li>
        <li>Maintain clear service agreements stating coaching is not therapy</li>
        <li>Document all referrals and scope limitations</li>
        <li>Terminate coaching relationships if clinical needs emerge</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h4>Marketing & Representation</h4>
