    <h1>Tennessee - Life Coach Legal Requirements</h1>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> Life coaches do NOT require licensing in Tennessee. However, coaches must maintain clear boundaries with clinical mental health practice.</p>
        <p><strong>Critical Distinction:</strong> Life coaching focuses on goal-setting, motivation, and personal development. Coaches may NOT diagnose or treat mental health conditions or use protected clinical titles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert-box">
        <h4>Tennessee-Specific Alert</h4>
        <p>The Tennessee Board of Professional Counselors, Marital and Family Therapists, and Clinical Pastoral Therapists has issued policy statements emphasizing the distinction between life coaching and licensed professional counseling. Coaches must be vigilant in maintaining clear boundaries.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Legal Definition</h2>
    <p>Tennessee does not provide a statutory definition of "life coach" as it is not a regulated profession. Life coaching is generally understood as a professional relationship focused on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Goal setting and achievement</li>
        <li>Personal and professional development</li>
        <li>Accountability and motivation</li>
        <li>Performance enhancement</li>
        <li>Career guidance and transitions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <p><strong>No licensing required.</strong> Tennessee does not regulate life coaching as a profession. Life coaches may practice without state-issued licenses, certifications, or registrations.</p>

    <p>However, many coaches voluntarily obtain certification through professional organizations such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>International Coaching Federation (ICF)</li>
        <li>Center for Credentialing & Education (CCE)</li>
        <li>International Association of Coaching (IAC)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practice Regulations</h2>
    <p>While life coaching itself is unregulated, coaches must comply with general business regulations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Business registration with the Tennessee Secretary of State (if operating as LLC, corporation, etc.)</li>
        <li>Assumed name registration (if using DBA)</li>
        <li>General liability insurance (recommended but not required)</li>
        <li>Compliance with consumer protection laws</li>
        <li>Adherence to ethical standards (if certified through professional organization)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Boundaries with Clinical Professionals</h2>
    <p>Tennessee strictly regulates mental health professionals through multiple licensing boards. Life coaches must NOT:</p>

    <h4>Prohibited Activities</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Diagnose mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc.)</li>
        <li>Provide psychotherapy or clinical counseling</li>
        <li>Treat mental illness or psychological disorders</li>
        <li>Prescribe medication or recommend specific medical treatments</li>
        <li>Hold themselves out as psychologists, therapists, or counselors</li>
        <li>Use protected titles without proper licensure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Restrictions & Prohibitions</h2>

    <h3>Protected Titles</h3>
    <p>Under Tennessee law, the following titles are protected and may NOT be used without proper licensure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Psychologist (Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-11-201 et seq.)</li>
        <li>Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) (Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-22-101 et seq.)</li>
        <li>Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) (Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-23-101 et seq.)</li>
        <li>Licensed Marital and Family Therapist (LMFT) (Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-22-101 et seq.)</li>
        <li>Licensed Clinical Pastoral Therapist (LCPT) (Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-22-101 et seq.)</li>
        <li>Mental Health Counselor</li>
        <li>Therapist (when implying clinical practice)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Board Policy on Life Coaching</h3>
    <p>The Tennessee Board of Professional Counselors has clarified that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Life coaching that focuses on personal growth, goal achievement, and motivation does not require licensure</li>
        <li>Any practice that involves diagnosis, treatment planning, or therapeutic intervention requires professional counselor licensure</li>
        <li>Coaches must clearly distinguish their services from clinical counseling in all marketing and client communications</li>
        <li>The Board may investigate complaints where coaching appears to cross into unlicensed practice of counseling</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scope of Practice Limitations</h3>
    <p>Life coaches must clearly distinguish their services from clinical mental health treatment. When a client presents with mental health concerns, coaches should:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Refer to licensed mental health professionals</li>
        <li>Decline to work with clients beyond their scope</li>
        <li>Maintain clear service agreements stating coaching is not therapy</li>
        <li>Document referrals and scope limitations</li>
    </ul>
