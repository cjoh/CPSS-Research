    <h1>New Mexico - Life Coach Legal Requirements</h1>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> New Mexico does NOT require licensing for life coaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Critical Boundary:</strong> Life coaches cannot diagnose, treat, or present themselves as mental health professionals.</p>
        <p><strong>Primary Risk:</strong> Unauthorized practice of counseling or psychology is a fourth-degree felony.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Legal Definition</h2>
    <p>New Mexico law does not provide a specific definition for "life coach." Life coaching is considered an unregulated profession in the state, distinct from licensed mental health professions such as psychology, professional counseling, marriage and family therapy, social work, and art therapy.</p>

    <h2>Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <p><strong>No license is required</strong> to practice as a life coach in New Mexico. The state does not have a regulatory framework, certification process, or registration system for life coaches.</p>

    <p>Life coaches may operate as independent practitioners or business owners without state oversight, provided they stay within the boundaries of coaching and do not engage in activities reserved for licensed mental health professionals.</p>

    <h2>Practice Regulations</h2>
    <p>While life coaching itself is unregulated, New Mexico has comprehensive regulations governing mental health professions that create clear boundaries for life coaches:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Psychology:</strong> Licensed under NMSA 1978, § 61-9-1 et seq. by the Board of Psychologist Examiners</li>
        <li><strong>Counseling and Therapy:</strong> Licensed under NMSA 1978, § 61-9A-1 et seq. by the Counseling and Therapy Practice Board</li>
        <li><strong>Social Work:</strong> Licensed under NMSA 1978, § 61-31-1 et seq. by the Board of Social Work Examiners</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Counseling and Therapy Practice Board regulates multiple professions including professional counselors, marriage and family therapists, and art therapists.</p>

    <h2>Boundaries with Clinical Professionals</h2>
