            <li>Life coaching is <strong>explicitly exempt</strong> from mental health professional regulation</li>
            <li>Colorado law specifically recognizes life coaching as distinct from clinical practice</li>

    <h2>Legal Definition</h2>
    <p>Colorado does not provide a detailed statutory definition for "life coach," but Colorado law explicitly recognizes life coaching as a profession distinct from licensed mental health services. Life coaching is generally understood as a professional relationship focused on:</p>

        <li>Career advancement and transitions</li>

        <h4>Colorado's Explicit Coach Exemption</h4>
        <p>Colorado's Mental Health Practice Act includes specific exemptions that recognize life coaching as a legitimate profession that does not require mental health licensure, provided coaches stay within appropriate boundaries.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h4>No License Required</h4>
        <p>Colorado does <strong>not require</strong> life coaches to obtain any state license, certification, or registration to practice. Life coaches may begin practicing immediately without state oversight.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Business Registration</h3>
    <p>While no professional license is required, life coaches should consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Registering their business with the Colorado Secretary of State</li>
        <li>Obtaining a sales tax license from the Colorado Department of Revenue if selling taxable services</li>
        <li>Obtaining a business license from their local municipality if required</li>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p class="warning">CRITICAL DISTINCTION:</p>
