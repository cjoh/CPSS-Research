    <h1>Oklahoma - Life Coach Legal Requirements</h1>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> Oklahoma does NOT require licensing for life coaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Critical Boundary:</strong> Life coaches cannot diagnose, treat, or present themselves as mental health professionals.</p>
        <p><strong>Primary Risk:</strong> Unauthorized practice of psychology or counseling is a misdemeanor.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Legal Definition</h2>
    <p>Oklahoma law does not provide a specific definition for "life coach." Life coaching is considered an unregulated profession in the state, distinct from licensed mental health professions such as psychology, professional counseling, marriage and family therapy, and social work.</p>

    <h2>Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <p><strong>No license is required</strong> to practice as a life coach in Oklahoma. The state does not have a regulatory framework, certification process, or registration system for life coaches.</p>

    <p>Life coaches may operate as independent practitioners or business owners without state oversight, provided they stay within the boundaries of coaching and do not engage in activities reserved for licensed mental health professionals.</p>

    <h2>Practice Regulations</h2>
    <p>While life coaching itself is unregulated, Oklahoma has comprehensive regulations governing mental health professions that create clear boundaries for life coaches:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Psychology:</strong> Licensed under 59 Okla. Stat. § 1351 et seq. by the Oklahoma Board of Behavioral Health Licensure</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Counseling:</strong> Licensed under 59 Okla. Stat. § 1901 et seq. by the Oklahoma Board of Behavioral Health Licensure</li>
        <li><strong>Marriage and Family Therapy:</strong> Licensed under 59 Okla. Stat. § 1901 et seq. by the Oklahoma Board of Behavioral Health Licensure</li>
        <li><strong>Social Work:</strong> Licensed under 59 Okla. Stat. § 1250 et seq. by the Oklahoma State Board of Licensed Social Workers</li>
    </ul>
