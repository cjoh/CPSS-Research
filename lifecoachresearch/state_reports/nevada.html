    <h1>Nevada - Life Coach Legal Requirements</h1>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> Nevada does NOT require licensing for life coaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Critical Boundary:</strong> Life coaches cannot diagnose, treat, or present themselves as mental health professionals.</p>
        <p><strong>Primary Risk:</strong> Unauthorized practice of psychology or counseling is a felony in Nevada.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Legal Definition</h2>
    <p>Nevada law does not provide a specific definition for "life coach." Life coaching is considered an unregulated profession in the state, distinct from licensed mental health professions such as psychology, clinical social work, marriage and family therapy, and professional counseling.</p>

    <h2>Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <p><strong>No license is required</strong> to practice as a life coach in Nevada. The state does not have a regulatory framework, certification process, or registration system for life coaches.</p>

    <p>Life coaches may operate as independent practitioners or business owners without state oversight, provided they stay within the boundaries of coaching and do not engage in activities reserved for licensed mental health professionals.</p>

    <h2>Practice Regulations</h2>
    <p>While life coaching itself is unregulated, Nevada has strict regulations governing mental health professions that create clear boundaries for life coaches:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Psychology:</strong> Licensed under NRS Chapter 641 by the Nevada Board of Psychological Examiners</li>
        <li><strong>Marriage and Family Therapy:</strong> Licensed under NRS Chapter 641A by the Board of Examiners for Marriage and Family Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical Professional Counseling:</strong> Licensed under NRS Chapter 641A</li>
        <li><strong>Social Work:</strong> Licensed under NRS Chapter 641B by the Board of Examiners for Social Workers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Boundaries with Clinical Professionals</h2>
    <p>Life coaches in Nevada must understand and respect the boundaries between coaching and licensed mental health practice:</p>

    <h3>What Life Coaches CANNOT Do:</h3>

        <li>Use titles such as "therapist," "counselor," "psychologist," or "social worker"</li>
        <li>Claim to treat, cure, or heal mental illness</li>
        <li>Practice within the defined scope of licensed mental health professions</li>
        <li>Present credentials in a way that implies clinical training or licensure</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Life Coaches CAN Do:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide goal-setting and accountability services</li>
        <li>Offer motivational support and encouragement</li>
        <li>Help clients develop action plans for personal or professional growth</li>
        <li>Facilitate self-discovery and exploration of values</li>
        <li>Use the title "life coach" or "coach"</li>
        <li>Work with clients who are mentally healthy and seeking personal development</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Restrictions & Prohibitions</h2>

        <li>Psychotherapy and counseling services</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Penalty:</strong> Violation is a <strong>category D felony</strong>, punishable by imprisonment and/or fines.</p>

    <h3>Unauthorized Practice of Marriage and Family Therapy or Clinical Counseling</h3>
