    <h1>Indiana - Life Coach Legal Requirements</h1>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>NO LICENSE REQUIRED:</strong> Indiana does not require life coaches to obtain any state license or certification to practice.</p>
        <p><strong>KEY RESTRICTION:</strong> Life coaches cannot diagnose or treat mental health conditions, and must not represent themselves as licensed mental health professionals.</p>
        <p><strong>STATUS:</strong> Life coaching is an unregulated profession in Indiana.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Legal Definition</h2>
    <p>Indiana law does not specifically define "life coaching" as a regulated profession. Life coaches operate as business consultants or personal development professionals who help clients achieve personal and professional goals through guidance, accountability, and strategic planning.</p>
    <p>Life coaching is distinguished from mental health counseling in that it is future-focused, goal-oriented, and does not involve diagnosis or treatment of mental disorders.</p>

    <h2>Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <p><strong>No state license is required</strong> to practice as a life coach in Indiana.</p>

    <h3>What This Means:</h3>

        <li>No state-issued credentials needed to practice</li>

        <li>Center for Credentialing & Education (CCE)</li>
        <li>International Association of Coaching (IAC)</li>
