    <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>NO LICENSING REQUIRED:</strong> West Virginia does not require professional licensing, certification, or registration to practice as a life coach or executive coach.</p>

    </div>

        <li><strong>Referral Network:</strong> Develop relationships with licensed mental health professionals for appropriate referrals</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Coach is not a licensed mental health professional</li>
                <li>Coaching is not therapy or counseling</li>

    </ul>
