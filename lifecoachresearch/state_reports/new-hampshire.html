    <h1>New Hampshire - Life Coach Legal Requirements</h1>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> New Hampshire does NOT require licensing for life coaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Critical Boundary:</strong> Life coaches cannot diagnose, treat, or present themselves as mental health professionals.</p>
        <p><strong>Legislative Note:</strong> Attempted licensing legislation (HB 1058) failed in 2019-2020.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert">
        <p><strong>Historical Context:</strong> In 2019-2020, New Hampshire considered House Bill 1058, which would have required life coaches to obtain state licensure. The bill was ultimately defeated, and life coaching remains an unregulated profession in the state.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Legal Definition</h2>
    <p>New Hampshire law does not provide a specific definition for "life coach." Life coaching is considered an unregulated profession in the state, distinct from licensed mental health professions such as psychology, clinical mental health counseling, marriage and family therapy, and pastoral psychotherapy.</p>

    <h2>Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <p><strong>No license is required</strong> to practice as a life coach in New Hampshire. Following the defeat of HB 1058, the state does not have a regulatory framework, certification process, or registration system for life coaches.</p>

    <p>Life coaches may operate as independent practitioners or business owners without state oversight, provided they stay within the boundaries of coaching and do not engage in activities reserved for licensed mental health professionals.</p>

    <h2>Practice Regulations</h2>
    <p>While life coaching itself is unregulated, New Hampshire has strict regulations governing mental health professions that create clear boundaries for life coaches:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Psychology:</strong> Licensed under RSA Chapter 329-B by the Board of Psychologists</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical Mental Health Counseling:</strong> Licensed under RSA Chapter 330-A by the Board of Mental Health Practice</li>
        <li><strong>Marriage and Family Therapy:</strong> Licensed under RSA Chapter 330-A by the Board of Mental Health Practice</li>
        <li><strong>Pastoral Psychotherapy:</strong> Licensed under RSA Chapter 330-A by the Board of Mental Health Practice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Boundaries with Clinical Professionals</h2>
    <p>Life coaches in New Hampshire must understand and respect the boundaries between coaching and licensed mental health practice:</p>

    <h3>What Life Coaches CANNOT Do:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Diagnose mental health conditions or psychological disorders</li>
        <li>Provide psychotherapy or clinical treatment</li>
        <li>Use titles such as "therapist," "counselor," "psychologist," or "clinical mental health counselor"</li>
        <li>Claim to treat, cure, or heal mental illness</li>
        <li>Practice within the defined scope of licensed mental health professions</li>
        <li>Present credentials in a way that implies clinical training or licensure</li>
        <li>Hold themselves out as licensed mental health practitioners</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Life Coaches CAN Do:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide goal-setting and accountability services</li>
        <li>Offer motivational support and encouragement</li>
        <li>Help clients develop action plans for personal or professional growth</li>
        <li>Facilitate self-discovery and exploration of values</li>
        <li>Use the title "life coach" or "coach"</li>
        <li>Work with clients who are mentally healthy and seeking personal development</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Restrictions & Prohibitions</h2>

    <h3>Unauthorized Practice of Psychology</h3>
    <p>Under <strong>RSA 329-B:22</strong>, it is unlawful to engage in the practice of psychology without a license. The statute defines the practice of psychology to include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Psychological testing and assessment</li>
        <li>Diagnosis and treatment of mental and emotional disorders</li>
        <li>Psychotherapy and counseling services</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Penalty:</strong> Violation is a misdemeanor, with potential criminal penalties and civil liability.</p>

    <h3>Unauthorized Practice of Mental Health Counseling</h3>
    <p>Under <strong>RSA 330-A:27</strong>, practicing clinical mental health counseling, marriage and family therapy, or pastoral psychotherapy without proper licensure is prohibited.</p>

    <p>The Board of Mental Health Practice has authority to investigate complaints and take enforcement action against individuals practicing without appropriate licensure.</p>
