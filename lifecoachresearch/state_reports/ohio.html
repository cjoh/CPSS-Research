    <h1>Ohio - Life Coach Legal Requirements</h1>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>Key Finding:</strong> Ohio does NOT require licensing for life coaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Critical Boundary:</strong> Life coaches cannot diagnose, treat, or present themselves as mental health professionals.</p>
        <p><strong>Primary Risk:</strong> Unauthorized practice of psychology or counseling is a first-degree misdemeanor.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Legal Definition</h2>
    <p>Ohio law does not provide a specific definition for "life coach." Life coaching is considered an unregulated profession in the state, distinct from licensed mental health professions such as psychology, professional counseling, marriage and family therapy, and social work.</p>

    <h2>Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <p><strong>No license is required</strong> to practice as a life coach in Ohio. The state does not have a regulatory framework, certification process, or registration system for life coaches.</p>

    <p>Life coaches may operate as independent practitioners or business owners without state oversight, provided they stay within the boundaries of coaching and do not engage in activities reserved for licensed mental health professionals.</p>

    <h2>Practice Regulations</h2>
    <p>While life coaching itself is unregulated, Ohio has comprehensive regulations governing mental health professions that create clear boundaries for life coaches:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Psychology:</strong> Licensed under Ohio Revised Code Chapter 4732 by the State Board of Psychology</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Counseling:</strong> Licensed under Ohio Revised Code Chapter 4757 by the Counselor, Social Worker, and Marriage and Family Therapist Board</li>
        <li><strong>Marriage and Family Therapy:</strong> Licensed under Ohio Revised Code Chapter 4757 by the Counselor, Social Worker, and Marriage and Family Therapist Board</li>
        <li><strong>Social Work:</strong> Licensed under Ohio Revised Code Chapter 4757 by the Counselor, Social Worker, and Marriage and Family Therapist Board</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Boundaries with Clinical Professionals</h2>
    <p>Life coaches in Ohio must understand and respect the boundaries between coaching and licensed mental health practice:</p>

        <li>Claim to treat, cure, or heal mental illness</li>
        <li>Practice within the defined scope of licensed mental health professions</li>
