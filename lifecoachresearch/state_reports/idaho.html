    <h1>Idaho - Life Coach Legal Requirements</h1>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <p><strong>NO LICENSE REQUIRED:</strong> Idaho does not require life coaches to obtain any state license or certification to practice.</p>
        <p><strong>KEY RESTRICTION:</strong> Life coaches cannot diagnose or treat mental health conditions, and must not represent themselves as licensed mental health professionals.</p>
        <p><strong>STATUS:</strong> Life coaching is an unregulated profession in Idaho.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Legal Definition</h2>
    <p>Idaho law does not specifically define "life coaching" as a regulated profession. Life coaches operate as business consultants or personal development professionals who help clients achieve personal and professional goals through guidance, accountability, and strategic planning.</p>
    <p>Life coaching is distinguished from mental health counseling in that it is future-focused, goal-oriented, and does not involve diagnosis or treatment of mental disorders.</p>

    <h2>Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <p><strong>No state license is required</strong> to practice as a life coach in Idaho.</p>

    <h3>What This Means:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No formal education requirements mandated by the state</li>
        <li>No state examination required</li>
        <li>No registration with state agencies necessary</li>
        <li>No continuing education mandated by law</li>
        <li>No state-issued credentials needed to practice</li>

    <ul>
        <li>International Coach Federation (ICF)</li>
        <li>Center for Credentialing & Education (CCE)</li>
        <li>International Association of Coaching (IAC)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practice Regulations</h2>
    <p>While life coaching itself is unregulated, Idaho life coaches must comply with general business regulations:</p>
