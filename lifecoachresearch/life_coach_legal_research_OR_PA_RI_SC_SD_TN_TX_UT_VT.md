## Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** Life coaching is an unregulated profession in all nine states examined. No state requires professional licensing, certification, or registration to practice as a life coach or executive coach. However, life coaches must be careful not to engage in activities that constitute the practice of licensed mental health professions (psychotherapy, counseling, clinical social work).

**Universal Restrictions Across All States:**
- Cannot diagnose mental health conditions
- Cannot treat mental illness, emotional disorders, or substance abuse
- Cannot use therapeutic terminology that implies mental health treatment
- Cannot represent themselves as licensed therapists, counselors, or psychologists
- May face felony charges for unauthorized practice of psychotherapy

**Business Licensing:** While professional licensing is not required, coaches may need to obtain general business licenses at the city, county, or state level depending on local regulations.

**National Context:** "While every state requires therapists to be licensed, no state regulates or licenses coaches."

### Regulations Around Coaching Practice
**No state regulations** govern life coaching practice in Texas. Life coaching remains an unregulated profession throughout the state.

## UTAH

### Legal Definition
**No statutory definition** currently exists in Utah law for "life coach" or "executive coach."

### Licensing Requirements
**NONE - Currently.** There are currently no legal requirements mandating a certification to practice as a life coach in Utah. You can start your life coaching business without a specific certification.

**Legislative History:**
- **2024:** Senate Bill 251 (SB251) proposed establishing a registration process for life coaches through the Division of Professional Licensing (DOPL), but the bill was not enacted. The committee recommended further study for potential consideration in the 2025 General Session.
- **2025:** Utah took a different approach with Senate Bill 48 (SB48).

### Recent Legislative Developments - SB48 (2025)

**Senate Bill 48: "Behavioral Health Amendments"**
- **Signed:** March 26, 2025
- **Effective Date:** May 7, 2025
- **Approach:** Rather than regulating life coaches directly, Utah chose to strengthen protections around licensed mental health practice and increase enforcement capabilities.

**Key Provisions of SB48:**

1. **Expanded Definition of Mental Health Therapy:**
   - Added "conveying an opinion as to the validity of an individual's established diagnosis" to the definition of mental health therapy

2. **Mental Health Professionals Education and Enforcement Fund:**
   - Created new fund to support education and training of licensees and the public
   - Provides resources for investigation and enforcement

3. **Enhanced Enforcement Authority:**
   - Gives DOPL resources to investigate life coaches who may be acting unlawfully
   - Allows proactive investigation of those advertising or providing services within protected scope of practice
   - Enables action before harm occurs

4. **Scope Protection:**
   - Expands the scope of practice for mental health therapists
   - Draws "this fence around mental health and what mental health professionals do at the exclusion of everyone else"
   - Makes it clear that only licensed therapists can provide mental health treatment

**Legislative Intent:**
- Prevent bad actors in the mental health field from pivoting to life coaching when they have faced disciplinary action
- Address concerns about life coaches working alongside licensed therapists to circumvent licensing requirements (e.g., coach working with child while licensed professional only sees parent)

**Source:** S.B. 48 Behavioral Health Amendments, le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0048.html

### Regulations Around Coaching Practice

**Current Status:** Life coaching remains unregulated in Utah, but life coaches face increased scrutiny if their services fall within the protected scope of mental health practice.

**Post-SB48 Environment:** DOPL can proactively investigate and take action against life coaches who are advertising or holding themselves out for providing services that are clearly in a protected scope of practice.

### Legal Boundaries Between Coaches and Clinical Professionals

**Clinical Professionals Regulated:**
Utah regulates mental health professionals through the Division of Professional Licensing (DOPL):

- **Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselors**
- **Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists**
- **Licensed Clinical Social Workers**
- **Licensed Psychologists**
- **Licensed Substance Abuse Counselors**

**Regulatory Authority:** Utah Division of Professional Licensing (DOPL)
**Website:** dopl.utah.gov/behavioral-health/

**New Clarity Under SB48:**
The law makes it clear that only licensed therapists can provide mental health treatment. Life coaches can continue to exist unlicensed, but the new bill allows DOPL to proactively go after those who are advertising or holding themselves out for providing services that are clearly in a protected scope of practice.

### Restrictions and Prohibitions

Life coaches are **prohibited from:**
1. Providing mental health treatment
2. Diagnosing mental health conditions
3. Conveying opinions about the validity of established diagnoses (new under SB48)
4. Developing plans to manage mental health conditions
5. Treating mental illness, trauma, or substance abuse
6. Advertising services that fall within protected scope of mental health practice
7. Using protected titles or representing themselves as licensed mental health professionals

**Enforcement History:**
- Over the last decade, Utah licensing authorities cited 25 people for unauthorized practice in the mental health field, including four life coaches
- Citations and fines have been used, but enforcement was historically limited
- One life coach was fined $1,000 for advertising as a "psychotherapist"
- Another individual (Denim Slade) was cited and fined $250 for advertising "Lifespan Integration Therapy" and treating trauma

**Post-SB48:** Enhanced enforcement capabilities and proactive investigation authority.

### Relevant Statutes and Regulations

**Current Legislation:**
- **Senate Bill 48 (2025):** "Behavioral Health Amendments"
  - Effective: May 7, 2025
  - Reference: le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0048.html

**Historical Legislation:**
- **Senate Bill 251 (2024):** "Life Coaching Requirements"
  - Proposed registration system for life coaches
  - Not enacted; recommended for further study
  - Reference: le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/SB0251.html

**Administrative Rules:**
- Utah Division of Professional Licensing rules for Behavioral Health professions
- Available at: dopl.utah.gov

### Professional Guidance
**Voluntary Certification:** Coaches are encouraged to pursue professional certification through organizations like ICF to demonstrate professional standards.

**ICF Coverage:** Utah is served by ICF High Country chapter.

### Notable Context
Utah's approach has drawn national attention:
- ProPublica investigation documented cases of therapists who lost licenses turning to life coaching
- Concerns about conversion therapy being provided under guise of life coaching
- National discussion about whether life coaching should be regulated
- Utah chose enforcement-focused approach rather than direct regulation of coaching

**Key Sources:**
- ProPublica: "When Therapists Lose Their Licenses, Some Turn to the Unregulated Life Coaching Industry Instead" (2024)
- ProPublica: "New Utah Law Seeks to Crack Down on Life Coaches Offering Therapy Without a License" (2025)

### Additional Notes
- Utah is unique in having recent, specific legislation addressing the life coaching/mental health boundary
- SB48 represents a novel approach: strengthening mental health practice protections rather than regulating coaching directly
- This is the most active state legislature regarding life coaching regulation among the nine states examined
- Life coaches in Utah should be particularly careful about advertising language and scope of services following SB48's effective date (May 7, 2025)

- Understanding the boundaries between coaching and licensed counseling/therapy
- Being careful not to diagnose or treat mental health conditions

### Additional Notes
- Life coaching can be practiced without state licensure in Vermont
- Clear distinction between coaching (goal-setting, motivation, personal development) and licensed clinical practice (diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions)
- Vermont has clear regulatory structure for mental health professionals but does not extend this to life coaching

**Important Clarification:**
The "Life Settlement Broker" licensing referenced in some Vermont licensing materials relates to insurance/financial services (negotiating life insurance settlements), not life coaching. This is a completely different profession.

**Finding:** Executive coaching and business coaching are treated identically to life coaching across all nine states:
- No licensing requirements
- No certification mandates
- No state regulation
- Same restrictions apply (cannot diagnose/treat mental health conditions)

**Exception:** If providing advice requiring other professional licenses (securities, insurance, legal advice), appropriate licensure in those fields would be required.

### Licensed Professionals Offering Coaching

**Special Consideration:** Licensed therapists, counselors, psychologists, and social workers who also offer coaching services face unique considerations:

1. **Dual Accountability:** May be held to their professional licensing standards even when providing "coaching" services
2. **Scope Ambiguity:** Licensing boards may view coaching as falling under their regulatory scope
3. **Ethical Requirements:** Must maintain professional ethics and boundaries
4. **Documentation:** Should clearly distinguish coaching from clinical services
5. **Risk:** Higher liability risk due to professional licensure

**Example:** Texas BHEC explicitly warns that licensed professionals are not exempt from discipline simply because services are labeled "coaching."

### Voluntary Certification Landscape

**International Coach Federation (ICF):**
- Most widely recognized coaching certification body
- Three credential levels: ACC (Associate Certified Coach), PCC (Professional Certified Coach), MCC (Master Certified Coach)
- ICF-accredited training programs available in all nine states
- State/regional chapters:
  - Oregon: ICF Oregon
  - Tennessee: ICF Tennessee
  - South Carolina: ICF South Carolina Chapter
  - Multi-state: ICF High Country (serves South Dakota, Utah, and others)

**Other Organizations:**
- International Association of Coaches (IAC)
- Center for Credentialing & Education (CCE) - Board Certified Coach (BCC)
- Various specialized coaching certification programs

**Market Reality:** While not legally required, certification enhances:
- Professional credibility
- Client trust
- Marketing effectiveness
- Professional development
- Ethical standards adherence

### Business Licensing Requirements

**Key Distinction:** Professional licensing (not required) vs. business licensing (may be required)

**Business Registration Factors:**
1. **Entity Type:**
   - Sole proprietorship: Often no state registration required
   - LLC/Corporation: State filing required

2. **Location-Based Requirements:**
   - **City-level:** Many cities require business licenses
   - **County-level:** Generally less common
   - **State-level:** Some states require state business licenses
   - **Home-based:** May need home occupation permits

3. **Zoning Compliance:**
   - Residential zoning may restrict business operations
   - HOA restrictions may apply
   - Lease agreements may prohibit business use

**Recommendation:** Coaches should check local city/county requirements as these vary significantly by jurisdiction.

### Marketing and Advertising Considerations

**Risk Areas:**
1. **Clinical Language:** Avoid terms like "treat," "diagnose," "therapy," "counseling," "cure"
2. **Outcome Claims:** Avoid guaranteeing therapeutic outcomes or mental health improvements
3. **Credentials:** Clearly distinguish coaching certifications from clinical licenses
4. **Scope Description:** Clearly describe coaching as distinct from therapy/counseling
5. **Mental Health References:** Avoid language suggesting treatment of mental health conditions

**Safer Approach:**
- Focus on goal achievement, personal development, life transitions
- Use terms like "support," "facilitate," "guide," "empower"
- Clearly state that coaching is not therapy or counseling
- Include disclaimers about scope and limitations

### Insurance Recommendations

While not legally required in any of the nine states, professional liability insurance is strongly recommended:

**Coverage Types:**
1. **Professional Liability Insurance:** Protects against malpractice claims
2. **General Liability Insurance:** Protects against general business risks
3. **Cyber Liability:** For online coaching and data protection

**Rationale:**
- No statutory protections for coaches
- Potential for claims even when practicing within scope
- Legal defense costs even for frivolous claims
- Protection of personal assets

## CONCLUSION

Life coaching remains an unregulated profession across all nine states examined (Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Vermont). No state requires professional licensing, certification, or registration to practice as a life coach or executive coach.

However, this lack of regulation comes with significant responsibilities. Life coaches must carefully maintain boundaries with licensed mental health professions, avoiding diagnostic or therapeutic services that require clinical licensure. The consistent legal principle across all states is that while coaching is unrestricted, any crossing into the scope of practice of licensed mental health professionals can result in serious legal consequences, including criminal charges, administrative penalties, and civil liability.

The trend toward enforcement rather than regulation (as exemplified by Utah's 2025 SB48) suggests that states are more likely to strengthen protections around existing licensed professions rather than create new regulatory frameworks for coaching. This places the burden on individual coaches to understand and respect professional boundaries.

Coaches practicing in any of these nine states should:
1. Clearly distinguish their services from licensed mental health care
2. Avoid diagnostic and therapeutic language and activities
3. Maintain appropriate referral relationships with licensed professionals
4. Consider voluntary professional certification for credibility
5. Obtain proper business licenses at the local level
6. Carry professional liability insurance
7. Stay informed about evolving legal and regulatory landscapes
