# New York Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** Defined by certification board (not statute)

**Definition:** The New York board of certification defines a recovery coach as anyone wishing to promote recovery from addiction by connecting members with recovery support services designed to build recovery gains, create individual recovery options and help to remove barriers to recovery.

**Key Characteristic:** Recovery coaches operate at a NON-CLINICAL LEVEL and do not provide:
- Diagnosis
- Clinical services
- Medication
- Psychiatric care

**Citation:** New York Certification Board definitions; ASAP-NYCB (Association of Substance Abuse Programs - New York Certification Board)

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Legal Distinction:**

**Coaching:**
- NO state requires licensing for coaches
- Non-clinical support services
- Cannot diagnose or medicate
- Focuses on recovery support and connection to services

**Therapy (Mental Health Counseling):**
- New York Education Law Article 163 § 8402 defines mental health counseling as including "evaluation, assessment, amelioration, treatment, modification, or adjustment to a disability using assessment instruments and mental health counseling and psychotherapy"
- **Only licensed persons** may practice mental health counseling or use the title "mental health counselor"
- Violation of scope constitutes unauthorized practice (potential FELONY charges)

**CRITICAL WARNING:** Any coach who delivers services that mirror the scope of practice of a licensed psychotherapist risks felony charges.

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Certification Types in New York:**
1. **Certified Addiction Recovery Coach (CARC)**
2. **Certified Recovery Peer Advocate (CRPA)**
3. **Certified Recovery Peer Advocate Provisional (CRPA-P)**

**Training Requirements:**
- Total of 46 hours of training through ASAP-NYCB-approved courses
- CCAR Recovery Coach Academy (30 hours)
- Peer Ethics (16 hours)

**Independent Practice Status:**
- Recovery coaches are non-clinical providers
- **No explicit statutory prohibition on independent practice found**
- However, coaches must be extremely careful not to engage in activities that constitute practice of mental health counseling (which requires licensure)

**Key Legal Boundary:**
Recovery coaches can operate independently BUT must stay strictly within non-clinical boundaries. Any activity resembling psychotherapy, clinical assessment, diagnosis, or treatment planning could constitute unauthorized practice of mental health counseling.

**Recovery Coach Regulation:**
- **No specific statute found** - operates as voluntary certification system
- ASAP-NYCB (non-governmental certification board) administers credentials
- OASAS (Office of Addiction Services and Supports) provides general oversight of addiction services

**Key Regulatory Distinction:**
- Mental health counselors: MUST be licensed under Education Law
- Recovery coaches: NOT licensed profession, voluntary certification only

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION (not statutory licensure)

**Independent Practice:** Not explicitly prohibited, but MUST maintain strict non-clinical boundaries to avoid unauthorized practice charges

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** CLEAR LEGAL DISTINCTION
- Only licensed professionals can practice mental health counseling
- Recovery coaches provide non-clinical support only
- Crossing the line risks felony unauthorized practice charges

**Key Finding:** New York does not specifically regulate recovery coaching through statute, but the Mental Health Practitioners law creates a clear and legally enforced boundary between non-clinical coaching and licensed clinical practice.

**Critical Warnings for Recovery Coaches:**
1. **DO NOT** diagnose, assess, or treat mental health conditions
2. **DO NOT** provide psychotherapy or clinical counseling
3. **DO NOT** develop clinical treatment plans
4. **DO** stay strictly within peer support and recovery navigation roles
5. **DO** refer to licensed professionals for clinical needs
6. **UNDERSTAND** that violating scope of licensed practice can result in felony charges

**Recommendation:** Recovery coaches in New York should:
- Maintain clear documentation distinguishing their non-clinical services
- Have explicit service agreements clarifying non-clinical nature of work
- Obtain professional liability insurance
- Establish clear referral relationships with licensed professionals
- Stay current on scope of practice boundaries through continuing education
