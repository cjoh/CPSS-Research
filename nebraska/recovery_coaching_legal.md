# Nebraska Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** No specific statutory definition for "recovery coach" found in Nebraska law.

**Finding:** Nebraska uses the term "Certified Peer Support Specialist" (CPSS) rather than "recovery coach." The state operates an integrated certification program for individuals with lived experience of mental health and/or substance use disorders, rather than separate credentials.

**Citation:** Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Division of Behavioral Health, Office of Consumer Affairs certification guidelines.

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Scope of Practice:**
- Certified Peer Support Specialists must perform services only within the boundaries of their expertise
- CPSS shall be aware of the limits of their training and capabilities
- Required to collaborate with other professionals to best meet the needs of the person(s) served
- No specific statutory prohibition language found distinguishing coaching from therapy

**Key Limitation:** CPSS are explicitly NOT licensed mental health practitioners and operate under different regulatory framework than licensed professionals governed by the Uniform Credentialing Act.

**Citation:** Nebraska CPSS Code of Ethics and Guidelines

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Certification Requirements:**
- Must be 19 years of age
- High school diploma, GED, or higher degree required
- Must be lawfully present in the United States
- Self-identify as current or previous consumer of behavioral health services
- Attestation of minimum of one year of recovery required
- Complete 60 hours of Nebraska DHHS-approved Peer Support Core Curriculum training (including 10 hours ethics, minimum 40 hours live interactive)
- Pass IC&RC Peer Recovery Examination within six months of approval
- Read and agree to abide by the Nebraska CPSS Code of Ethics

**Independent Practice Status:**
- CPSS may open their own practice in Nebraska
- **However:** For Medicaid billing purposes, national certification in peer support and enrollment under a supervising practitioner, provider group, or provider organization is required
- No explicit prohibition on independent practice found, but Medicaid reimbursement structure suggests supervision requirements for billing

**Renewal:** Certificate must be renewed every 2 years with 20 hours of continuing education units.

**Citation:** Nebraska DHHS CPSS Certification Guidelines and Application Requirements

## Legal Citations

**Relevant Statutes/Regulations:**
- Nebraska Uniform Credentialing Act (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 38-2121 et seq.) - governs licensed mental health practitioners, NOT peer support specialists
- Nebraska DHHS Division of Behavioral Health CPSS Certification Guidelines (non-statutory administrative program)

**Key Finding:** Recovery coaching/peer support is NOT a licensed profession in Nebraska. It operates as a voluntary certification program administered by DHHS, separate from the statutory licensing framework for mental health professionals.

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** Voluntary certification program (not statutory licensure)

**Independent Practice:** Permitted for CPSS with own practice, but Medicaid billing requires affiliation with supervising practitioner or organization

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** No specific statutory boundary defined; CPSS operate under ethical guidelines requiring practice within scope of training and collaboration with licensed professionals when appropriate

**Key Distinction:** Recovery coaching/peer support is completely separate from licensed mental health practice in Nebraska and is not subject to the same statutory requirements as licensed counselors, therapists, or psychologists.
