# Oregon Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** NO SPECIFIC STATUTORY DEFINITION FOUND

**Finding:** Search results did not return specific statutes or administrative rules defining "recovery coach" as a distinct profession in Oregon law.

**Related Framework:** Oregon Health Authority has responsibility for establishing peer- and community-driven programs to provide behavioral health services, which may include recovery coach services, but no specific "recovery coach" legal definition was found.

**Citation:** Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) Chapter 430 (Mental Health and Developmental Disability Services) references behavioral health services generally, but does not specifically define recovery coaching.

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Licensed Professions:**
Oregon extensively regulates licensed mental health professionals including:
- Licensed Professional Counselors
- Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists
- Licensed Clinical Social Workers

These professions are governed by ORS Chapter 18.225 and Oregon Administrative Rules.

**Recovery Coach Status:**
- **NO SPECIFIC REGULATION FOUND** distinguishing recovery coaching from licensed therapy
- Recovery coaching appears to operate in unregulated or lightly regulated space
- No statutory scope of practice for recovery coaches identified

**Key Risk:** Without clear statutory boundaries, recovery coaches must be careful not to engage in activities that constitute practice of licensed professions (counseling, therapy, social work).

**Citation:** ORS Chapter 18.225 (Mental Health Counselors, Marriage and Family Therapists, Social Workers); Oregon Board of Licensed Professional Counselors and Therapists regulations

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Regulatory Status:**
- **NO STATE-SPECIFIC LICENSING OR CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOUND** for recovery coaches
- Search results indicate recovery coach training programs are available in Oregon
- Programs cover topics like trauma-informed care and ethics
- However, NO STATE MANDATE for certification was identified

**Independent Practice Status:**
- **UNREGULATED** - No specific state requirements found
- No prohibition on independent practice identified
- No supervision requirements identified
- **CAUTION:** Operating in unregulated space means no clear legal framework defining permissible activities

**Available Training:**
- Recovery coach training programs available in Oregon
- Topics include trauma-informed care and ethics
- Programs appear to be voluntary, not state-mandated

**Citation:** Recovery coach training program information; no specific statutory requirements found

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** APPEARS UNREGULATED - No specific state licensing, certification, or registration requirements found

**Independent Practice:** NO SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS IDENTIFIED - Appears permitted by default due to absence of regulation

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** NO CLEAR STATUTORY BOUNDARY - Recovery coaches must avoid activities that constitute practice of licensed professions

**Key Finding:** Oregon does not appear to specifically regulate recovery coaching as a distinct profession. Unlike peer support specialists or substance use disorder professionals (which have some state oversight), recovery coaches operate in an largely unregulated space.

**Critical Implications:**

**Advantages:**
1. No state certification costs or requirements
2. No specific training mandates (though voluntary training available)
3. Flexibility in practice structure
4. No supervision requirements

**Risks:**
1. No legal protection of title "recovery coach"
2. No clear scope of practice definition
3. Potential liability exposure without regulatory guidance
4. Must be extremely careful not to cross into licensed practice
5. No clear legal framework if disputes arise

**Recommendations:**

1. **Even though unregulated, recovery coaches should:**
   - Complete voluntary training programs in trauma-informed care and ethics
   - Obtain professional liability insurance
   - Develop clear service agreements defining non-clinical nature of services
   - Establish referral relationships with licensed professionals
   - Avoid any activities that could constitute counseling, therapy, diagnosis, or treatment

2. **Understand Boundaries with Licensed Professions:**
   - DO NOT provide psychotherapy or clinical counseling
   - DO NOT diagnose mental health or substance use conditions
   - DO NOT develop clinical treatment plans
   - DO NOT hold yourself out as providing clinical services
   - DO refer to licensed professionals for clinical needs

3. **Consider National Certification:**
   - While Oregon doesn't require it, national certifications (CARC, NCPRSS, etc.) can provide:
     - Professional credibility
     - Ethical guidelines
     - Training standards
     - Potential liability protection

4. **Monitor Legal Developments:**
   - Oregon may develop specific recovery coach regulations in the future
   - Stay informed about changes to behavioral health workforce laws
   - Be aware of any new administrative rules from Oregon Health Authority

**Important Note:** The absence of regulation does not mean unlimited scope. Recovery coaches must still avoid unauthorized practice of licensed professions, which could result in legal action under Oregon's professional practice laws.
