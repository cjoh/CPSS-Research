**Regulatory Status:** STATUTORY CERTIFICATION REQUIRED (as of August 1, 2023)

**Independent Practice:** Not explicitly addressed in statute; language suggests employment-based practice but does not prohibit independent practice. Further clarification needed from Nevada Certification Board.

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** Scope of practice defined by Nevada Certification Board aligned with SAMHSA guidelines; must refer to licensed providers when appropriate

**Key Finding:** Nevada is one of the few states with EXPLICIT STATUTORY DEFINITION and MANDATORY CERTIFICATION for peer recovery support specialists. This creates a clear legal framework but leaves independent practice question somewhat ambiguous.
