**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** DEFINED IN ADMINISTRATIVE CODE

**Legal Definition:** Ohio Administrative Code Rule 5122-29-15.1 defines "Certified peer recovery supporter" (CPRS) as "an individual, with a direct lived experience, who has self-identified as being in recovery from a mental health or substance use disorder and has been certified pursuant to Ohio Administrative Code Rule 5122-29-15.1."

**Key Requirement:** Must be at least 18 years of age at time of certification.

**Citation:** Ohio Admin. Code § 5122-29-15.1; § 5122-29-30

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Scope of Practice:**
- CPRS provide peer recovery support services based on lived experience
- Distinct from Licensed Independent Behavioral Health Practitioners (I-BHPs)
- I-BHPs are licensed by professional boards in Ohio and authorized to practice independently WITHOUT professional supervision
- CPRS do NOT have independent practice authority comparable to I-BHPs

**Service Settings:**
Peer recovery support can be provided:
- Through specialized recovery services program
- As component of assertive community treatment
- As component of substance use disorder residential treatment
- As substance use disorder outpatient treatment service
- As component of intensive home-based treatment service
- As component of mobile response and stabilization service

**Service Limitations:**
- Peer recovery support limited to FOUR HOURS PER DAY per recipient
- Must work within certified behavioral health organizations

**Citation:** Ohio Admin. Code § 5122-29-30; § 5122-30-32; § 5160-27-02; § 5160-43-04

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Certification Requirements:**
- Must be at least 18 years of age
- Self-identify as being in recovery from mental health or substance use disorder
- Complete required training and certification pursuant to Rule 5122-29-15.1
- Pass IC&RC Peer Recovery Examination (typical requirement for IC&RC-aligned certifications)

**Independent Practice Status:**
**NO INDEPENDENT PRACTICE PERMITTED**

**Critical Finding:** Recovery coaches in Ohio generally do NOT practice independently. They must work within certified behavioral health organizations under supervision structures.

**Supervision Requirements:**
- When providing Medicaid-covered services, CPRS typically require supervision
- Must work through certified behavioral health organizations
- This differs fundamentally from Licensed Independent Behavioral Health Practitioners who ARE authorized to practice independently without professional supervision

**2024 Update:**
- Peer Support Services became available for BOTH mental health (MH) and substance use disorder (SUD) beginning September 1, 2024
- This expanded the scope but did not change independent practice restrictions

**Citation:** Ohio Admin. Code § 5122-29-15.1; § 5160-43-04; Ohio Behavioral Health Manual 1.27 (August 2024)

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** STATE CERTIFICATION REQUIRED through administrative code

**Independent Practice:** PROHIBITED - Must work within certified behavioral health organizations under supervision

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** Clear distinction; CPRS operate under supervision within organizational settings, while Licensed Independent Behavioral Health Practitioners can practice independently

**Key Finding:** Ohio has established clear administrative regulations that:
1. Define and require certification for peer recovery supporters
2. PROHIBIT independent practice
3. REQUIRE work within certified behavioral health organizations
4. MANDATE supervision when providing Medicaid-covered services
5. LIMIT services to 4 hours per day per recipient

**Critical Limitation:** Unlike Licensed Independent Behavioral Health Practitioners who are "authorized to practice independently" and "not subject to professional supervision," CPRS in Ohio must work within organizational structures with appropriate supervision.

**2024 Updates:**
- Expansion of peer support services to both MH and SUD effective September 1, 2024
- No change to independent practice prohibitions

**Practical Implications:**
1. Cannot establish independent private practice as CPRS
2. Must be employed by or contracted through certified behavioral health organization
3. Must work under supervision structure
4. Limited to 4 hours of service per day per client
5. Must operate within specific service settings listed in administrative code

**Recommendation:** Recovery coaches in Ohio seeking to provide services should:
- Obtain CPRS certification through proper channels
- Affiliate with certified behavioral health organization
- Understand supervision requirements
- Recognize scope limitations (4-hour daily limit)
- Distinguish their role from independently licensed practitioners
