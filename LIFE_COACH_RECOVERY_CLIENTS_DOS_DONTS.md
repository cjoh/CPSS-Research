# Life Coaches Working With Clients in Recovery
## State-by-State DO/DON'T Guide

**Document Date:** November 5, 2025
**Purpose:** Clear guidance for life coaches on what they CAN and CANNOT do when working with clients who are in recovery from substance use or addiction

---

## CRITICAL CONTEXT

### Who This Guide Is For

**Life coaches** (not specifically "recovery coaches") who:
- Work with clients on life goals, career, relationships, personal development
- Have clients who happen to be in recovery from substance use/addiction
- Want to know: "Can I work with this person? What can I discuss? What's off-limits?"

### The Core Question

**"I'm a life coach. My client mentioned they're in recovery. Can I still work with them?"**

**General Answer:** YES, in most states, BUT you must understand the boundaries.

### Universal Framework: The "Context vs. Target" Principle

**✅ RECOVERY AS CONTEXT (Generally Okay):**
- Client is in recovery → You coach them on career goals
- You're aware of their recovery → You support life goals around it
- Recovery is part of their life → You help them build life that supports recovery

**❌ RECOVERY AS TARGET (Requires License):**
- You're treating the addiction
- You're modifying behaviors to address the substance use disorder
- You're creating strategies to maintain sobriety (that's clinical)
- You're diagnosing or assessing their addiction

### Key Principle Across All States

**You can coach someone WHO IS in recovery.**
**You cannot treat their recovery, addiction, or substance use disorder.**

## STATE-BY-STATE GUIDE

### ALABAMA

**Can life coaches work with clients in recovery?**
**YES**, with boundaries

**✅ YOU CAN:**
- Work with clients who are in recovery on life goals (career, relationships, personal development)
- Be aware they're in recovery and support their life goals around that
- Discuss how their recovery program fits into their life schedule
- Help them set and achieve non-clinical life goals
- Say: "I'm glad you're in recovery and have clinical support. Let's work on your career transition."
- Support them in building life structure that includes their recovery activities
- Celebrate recovery milestones as part of overall life progress

**❌ YOU CANNOT:**
- Treat emotional and mental disorders or substance use disorders (O.C.G.A. § 43-10A-3 equivalent)
- Use counseling or psychotherapy to evaluate and treat their addiction
- Create relapse prevention plans (that's clinical)
- Diagnose substance use disorder or assess their addiction severity
- Provide addiction counseling or therapy
- Say: "Let me help you treat your addiction"
- Work with them if they're actively using without medical supervision
- Replace or substitute for their clinical provider

**Alabama-Specific Considerations:**
- Life coaching is unregulated, but professional counseling is clearly defined
- If you're "evaluating and treating emotional and mental problems" related to addiction → you need a license
- Focus on life goals, not disorder treatment

**Required Client Situation:**
- ✅ Client is in recovery (stable, not actively using in crisis)
- ✅ Client has or is willing to get therapist/counselor
- ✅ Client understands you're a life coach, not treating their addiction

**Red Flags - Refer Out:**

   - [ ] Client has established sobriety/recovery time

2. **✅ Clinical Support:**
   - [ ] Client has licensed therapist, counselor, or clinical provider
   - [ ] Client is willing to maintain this relationship
   - [ ] You have contact info (optional but recommended with ROI)

3. **✅ Scope Clarity:**

4. **✅ Your Preparedness:**

### Written Agreement Must Include

**Every coaching agreement should state:**

2. "Coach is not a licensed mental health professional, addiction counselor, therapist, or medical provider."

3. "Client must maintain relationship with licensed clinical provider for any addiction treatment or mental health services."

4. "Coaching focuses on [career, relationships, personal development, life goals] and does not include diagnosis, treatment, or clinical assessment of substance use disorders."

5. "Coach may refer Client to clinical providers for issues outside coaching scope."

6. "Client agrees they are in recovery and have clinical support for their recovery needs."

### Language Framework: All States

**✅ SAFE LANGUAGE - Use This:**

- "Let's work on your career goals."
- "You're in recovery - that's great. Let's talk about [other life goals]."
- "I'm glad you have a therapist for your recovery. I'll support you on [career/relationships/development]."
- "Your recovery is important. Let's make sure your other goals support that."
- "Tell me about your life goals now that you're in recovery."
- "How can we build the life you want while you maintain your recovery program?"
- "Let's work on [specific life goal] while you continue working with your therapist."

**❌ UNSAFE LANGUAGE - Never Use This:**

- "I'll help you beat your addiction."
- "Let me treat your substance use disorder."
- "I'll provide recovery counseling."
- "You don't need a therapist, I can help you stay sober."
- "I'll diagnose your addiction level."

- "Let me assess your recovery progress." (clinical)

- "I'm a recovery coach." (in states where this is regulated/licensed)

### The "Context vs. Target" Test

**Ask yourself: What am I targeting?**

**✅ OKAY - Recovery as Context:**
- Client in recovery → I'm coaching them on career
- Client's recovery is background → I'm helping with life goals
- Recovery activities are part of their schedule → I'm helping them plan around it
- They have recovery foundation → I'm building other goals on it

**❌ NOT OKAY - Recovery as Target:**
- I'm working on their sobriety strategies (clinical)
- I'm helping them stay clean (clinical)
- I'm treating their addiction (clinical)
- I'm creating their relapse prevention plan (clinical)
- I'm assessing their recovery progress (clinical)

- Client expects you to treat their addiction
- Client in acute psychiatric or substance use crisis

- Client asks you to create treatment plan

### Red Flag Statements from Clients

❌ "Can you treat my addiction?" → They need licensed provider
❌ "I don't want a therapist, just a coach." → Not appropriate
❌ "I'm actively using but want coaching." → Need clinical intervention first
❌ "Can you help me figure out if I have an addiction?" → Need clinical assessment
❌ "I need someone to create my recovery plan." → Need clinical provider
❌ "I'm in crisis." → Need clinical/emergency services

**Better client statements:**

✅ "I'm in recovery and have a therapist. I want coaching on my career."
✅ "I've been sober 2 years and need help with life goals."
✅ "I'm working with a counselor on my recovery. I want coaching on relationships."

## APPENDIX: Sample Documents

### Sample Client Agreement Clause

"CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT: Life coaching focuses on personal development, goal-setting, and life planning. Coaching is not therapy, counseling, or treatment for substance use disorders, addiction, or mental health conditions.

[Coach Name] is a life coach and is not a licensed therapist, counselor, addiction specialist, psychologist, or medical doctor. Life coaching services do not include diagnosis, treatment, clinical assessment, or therapeutic intervention for substance use disorders or mental health conditions.

Client acknowledges:
- Client is responsible for maintaining relationship with licensed clinical provider(s) for any addiction treatment, mental health services, or medical care
- Client is in recovery and has clinical support for recovery-related needs
- Coach may refer Client to licensed professionals for issues outside coaching scope
- Coaching focuses on life goals including [career, relationships, personal development] and not on treating addiction or substance use disorders
- Coach will not create treatment plans, diagnose conditions, or provide clinical interventions"

### Sample Intake Questions

1. "What brings you to life coaching?"
2. "What are your goals for coaching?"
3. "I noticed you mentioned recovery. Are you currently working with a therapist or counselor?"
4. "How long have you been in recovery?"
5. "Who supports you clinically with your recovery?"
6. "Are you looking for life coaching on [career/relationships/goals] or are you looking for addiction treatment?" (If treatment → refer out)
7. "Do you understand that life coaching is not therapy or addiction treatment?"

### Sample Response Scripts

**When client mentions recovery:**
"Thanks for sharing that you're in recovery. That's great. Just so you know, as a life coach, I don't provide addiction treatment or therapy - that's for licensed professionals. Are you currently working with a therapist or counselor for your recovery? [If yes:] Great! They'll continue supporting your recovery, and I'll support you on [life goals]. [If no:] I require clients with substance use history to have clinical support. I can provide referrals, and once you're established with a provider, we can start coaching."

**When client asks about addiction help:**
"It sounds like you're looking for addiction treatment or counseling. That's outside my scope as a life coach - I'm not a therapist or addiction counselor. Let me give you some referrals to licensed professionals who can help with that. If you're also interested in life coaching for other goals once you have that clinical support in place, I'd be happy to talk further."

**When boundaries get fuzzy:**
"What you're describing sounds like it would be better addressed with your therapist/counselor. That's more clinical territory. In our coaching, I'll focus on [specific life goals]. Let's keep the addiction treatment work with your clinical provider."

---

## CONCLUSION

### Yes, You Can Work With Clients in Recovery

**The answer is YES in all states**, with these critical conditions:

1. **Client must have clinical support** - This is non-negotiable
2. **You're coaching on LIFE, not treating ADDICTION** - Stay clear on this
3. **Recovery is context, not target** - You support someone WHO IS in recovery, not treat the recovery
4. **Follow your state's boundaries** - Some states regulate "recovery coach" as specific role
5. **Stay in life coaching lane** - Don't drift into clinical territory

### The Key Distinction

**Life coaching someone who is in recovery** = Generally okay in all states

**Treating addiction/providing recovery counseling** = Requires license in all states

### When in Doubt

- Require client to have therapist
- Stay focused on life goals, not disorder treatment
- Use clear disclaimers
- Document appropriately
- Refer when needed
- Be more conservative in high-risk states (CA, MA, MT, IL, UT)

### Your Value

As a life coach, you provide tremendous value to clients in recovery:
- Supporting their career goals
- Helping rebuild relationships
- Assisting with life transitions
- Providing accountability for goals
- Helping them build the life they want

**You just can't treat the addiction itself. Leave that to the licensed professionals.**
