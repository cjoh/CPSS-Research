# North Carolina Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** No specific statutory definition for "recovery coach" found.

**Terminology:** North Carolina uses "Certified Peer Support Specialist" (NCCPSS) rather than "recovery coach."

**Definitions:**

1. **North Carolina Certified Peer Support Specialist (NCCPSS):** People living in recovery from mental illness and/or substance use disorder who support others who can benefit from their experiences. They have met North Carolina eligibility requirements, completed training, and are certified through an application process.

2. **Recovery Coaching:** Defined as peer-based addiction recovery support service that is NON-CLINICAL and designed to engage others beyond recovery initiation through stabilization and into recovery maintenance.

**Key Characteristic:** Recovery coaching is explicitly NON-CLINICAL support.

**Citation:** NC DHHS Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services; NC DHHS Certification Guidelines

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Scope of Practice:**
- Recovery coaching defined as "non-clinical" support
- UNC Behavioral Health Springboard approves NC Certified Peer Support Specialists to use additional training to work with individuals with substance use as primary or co-occurring disorder

**Regulatory Framework:**
- Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselors (LCMHC) are regulated under NC Gen. Stat. Chapter 90, Article 24
- NCCPSS certification is administered separately by NC DHHS (not a licensed profession)
- Clear distinction: licensed professionals vs. certified peer specialists

**Citation:** NC Gen. Stat. § 90-330 (Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselors Act); NC DHHS CPSS Program

**Citation:** NC DHHS NCCPSS Certification Requirements (effective July 1, 2024)

## Legal Citations

**Statutory Framework:**
- **NC Gen. Stat. Chapter 90, Article 24** - Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselors Act (for comparison; does NOT govern NCCPSS)
- **No specific statute found** governing recovery coaches or peer support specialists

**Administrative Program:**
- NC DHHS Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services administers NCCPSS certification
- This is a certification program, NOT a statutory licensure program

**Regulatory Authority:**
- North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NC DHHS)
- UNC Behavioral Health Springboard (training approval)

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** STATE-ADMINISTERED CERTIFICATION PROGRAM (not statutory licensure)

**Independent Practice:** UNCLEAR - No specific information found regarding independent practice permissions or restrictions

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** Defined as "non-clinical" service; distinct from licensed clinical practice but specific boundaries not statutorily defined

**Key Finding:** North Carolina operates a state certification program for peer support specialists (NCCPSS) administered by NC DHHS, but does NOT have statutory regulation of recovery coaching comparable to licensed mental health professions.

**Critical Gaps in Available Information:**
1. No clear guidance on independent practice permissions
2. No specific supervision requirements detailed in search results
3. No statutory scope of practice limitations found
4. Unclear whether organizational affiliation is required

**Recommendations:**
1. Contact NC DHHS Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services for clarification on:
   - Independent practice permissions
   - Supervision requirements
   - Scope of practice limitations
   - Organizational affiliation requirements

2. Review full NCCPSS certification guidelines and Code of Ethics

3. Understand that "non-clinical" designation creates implicit boundaries but exact parameters may require further clarification

**Important Note:** The absence of clear statutory regulation does not mean unrestricted practice. Certified peer support specialists must adhere to certification standards and ethical guidelines, and should avoid any activities that could constitute unauthorized practice of licensed professions.
