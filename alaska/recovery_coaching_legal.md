# Alaska Recovery Coaching Legal Requirements
**Research Date:** January 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Coaching

**Status:** No legal definition found

**Finding:** Alaska does not appear to have a statutory or regulatory definition of "recovery coaching" or "recovery coach" as a distinct profession.

**Related Certification:** Alaska Commission for Behavioral Health Certification (akcertification.org) offers certifications for behavioral health professionals, but specific recovery coach certification details were not found in available sources.

**Citation:** None - No specific statute or regulation located

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**What does state law say?**
No Alaska statute specifically addresses the boundary between recovery coaching and therapy.

**General Principle:**
Alaska, like most states, regulates the practice of:
- Psychology (AS 08.86)
- Professional Counseling
- Social Work
- Marriage and Family Therapy

**Prohibited Activities (Without License):**
Anyone practicing without a license cannot:
- Diagnose mental health or substance use disorders
- Provide psychotherapy
- Present themselves as a licensed mental health professional
- Engage in activities within the scope of practice of licensed professions

**Citation:** Alaska Statutes Title 8 (Business and Professions)

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Can recovery coaches operate independently?**
**STATUS: UNREGULATED - No prohibition found**

**Findings:**
1. No licensing requirement for recovery coaches
2. No certification requirement to practice as recovery coach
3. No employment restrictions found
4. No specific regulations governing independent practice

**Key Principle:**
In Alaska, recovery coaching appears to be an unregulated activity, provided the recovery coach does not engage in activities that fall within the scope of practice of licensed professions.

**What this means:**
- No state certification required to call yourself a recovery coach
- Can operate independent practice/LLC
- Must avoid activities requiring professional licensure
- Should carry appropriate liability insurance
