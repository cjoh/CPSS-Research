# Vermont Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** Defined through certification system

**Terminology:** Vermont uses "Peer Recovery Support Specialist" (PRSS) and "Certified Recovery Coach."

**Definition:** The International Certification and Reciprocity Consortium (IC&RC) Peer Recovery Certification is known as "Certified Recovery Coach" in Vermont, which acts as Vermont's Peer Recovery Support Specialist credentialing requirement.

**Key Characteristic:** Individuals with lived experience who provide recovery support services.

**Citation:** Vermont Department of Health, Division of Substance Use Programs; Prevention Works!VT (training provider); IC&RC standards

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Licensed Professional Framework:**
Vermont regulates licensed clinical professionals including:
- Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselors
- Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists
- Licensed Clinical Social Workers
- Licensed Psychotherapists
Governed by Vermont statutes Title 26 and Vermont Code of Regulations Chapter 350 (04-030-350)

**Recovery Coach Status:**
- Certified through IC&RC system (national certification)
- State certification as PRSS through Vermont Office of Professional Regulation
- Based on lived experience, not clinical training
- **Specific statutory boundaries not detailed in search results**

**Key Distinction:** Recovery coaches certified through separate system from licensed clinical professionals.

**Citation:** VT Code of Regulations 04-030-350 (licensed professionals); VT Department of Health PRSS program

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Certification Requirements:**
- Obtain IC&RC Certified Recovery Coach credential through Prevention Works!VT
- Apply for Peer Recovery Support Specialist (PRSS) Certification through Vermont Office of Professional Regulation
- IC&RC certification serves as prerequisite for Vermont PRSS certification
- **Specific training hours, examination details, and eligibility criteria not fully detailed in search results**

**CRITICAL LIMITATION - ORGANIZATIONAL EMPLOYMENT REQUIRED:**

**Finding:** Recovery support services need to be provided by Certified Peer Recovery Support Specialist **employed by a Vermont Department of Health Certified Recovery Services Organization**.

This indicates that **independent practice may NOT be permitted**; recovery coaches must work through certified organizations.

**Recovery Services Organization (RSO) Certification:**
- RSO Certification application period open until October 31st, 2025
- RSO Certification will be REQUIRED to receive funding from Department of Health for provision of recovery services beginning in State Fiscal Year 2027 (SFY27)
- Organizations providing recovery services must become certified

**Vermont's Best Practice Standards:**
- Vermont has published "Best Practice Standards for Recovery Services" (March 2023 Edition)
- These standards govern how recovery services are delivered
- **Specific scope of practice details not available in search results**

**Citation:** VT Department of Health RSO Certification requirements; VT Best Practice Standards for Recovery Services (March 2023)

## Legal Citations

**Statutory Framework:**
- **Vermont Statutes Title 26** - Professions and Occupations (governs licensed professionals)
- **No specific statute found** creating statutory licensure for recovery coaches
- Operates through certification system rather than statutory licensure

**Administrative Regulations:**
- **VT Code of Regulations 04-030-350** - Clinical Mental Health Counselors, Marriage and Family Therapists, and Psychotherapists (licensed professionals, NOT recovery coaches)
- **Vermont Best Practice Standards for Recovery Services** (March 2023) - Department of Health standards
- **RSO Certification Standards** - Department of Health organizational certification

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** STATE CERTIFICATION REQUIRED (two-step: IC&RC, then VT OPR)

**Independent Practice:** ORGANIZATIONAL EMPLOYMENT REQUIRED - Must work through VT Department of Health Certified Recovery Services Organization

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** Separate certification system from licensed clinical practice; specific boundaries not detailed in available information

**Key Finding:** Vermont requires a two-step certification process (IC&RC credential then state PRSS certification) and REQUIRES recovery coaches to work through Vermont Department of Health Certified Recovery Services Organizations, effectively prohibiting independent practice.

**Vermont's Unique Two-Step System:**

**Step 1: IC&RC Certification**
- Obtain IC&RC Certified Recovery Coach credential
- Training through Prevention Works!VT
- National standard certification
- Required before state certification

**Step 2: Vermont PRSS Certification**
- Apply through Vermont Office of Professional Regulation
- IC&RC credential serves as prerequisite
- State-level certification

**Step 3: Organizational Employment**
- Must work for VT Department of Health Certified Recovery Services Organization
- Organizations must obtain RSO Certification
- RSO Certification mandatory for state funding (beginning SFY27)

**Critical Implications:**

**Cannot Do in Vermont:**
1. ❌ Operate independent private practice
2. ❌ Provide recovery services without RSO affiliation
3. ❌ Practice with only IC&RC certification (must also get VT PRSS)
4. ❌ Work for non-certified organizations (as of SFY27)

**Must Do in Vermont:**
1. ✓ Obtain IC&RC Certified Recovery Coach credential
2. ✓ Apply for PRSS certification through OPR
3. ✓ Work for VT Department of Health Certified Recovery Services Organization
4. ✓ Ensure employer has RSO Certification (required for state funding SFY27+)
5. ✓ Follow Vermont Best Practice Standards for Recovery Services

**Timeline Considerations:**
- RSO Certification application period: Open until October 31, 2025
- RSO Certification required for state funding: Beginning SFY27 (State Fiscal Year 2027)
- Organizations providing recovery services should obtain certification now

**Vermont's Position on Regulatory Spectrum:**
- **More Restrictive Than:** South Dakota (no regulation), Pennsylvania (independent practice allowed), Texas (independent practice allowed)
- **Similar To:** Tennessee, Ohio (organizational employment required)
- **Unique Features:**
  - Two-step certification (IC&RC + state)
  - Organizational certification requirement (RSO)
  - Best Practice Standards document

**Critical Information Gaps:**
1. Specific IC&RC training hour requirements
2. PRSS certification examination requirements
3. Continuing education requirements
4. Detailed scope of practice
5. Supervision requirements within RSOs
6. Cost of certifications

**Recommendations:**

1. **For Aspiring Recovery Coaches:**
   - Contact Prevention Works!VT for IC&RC training information
   - Understand two-step certification process
   - Seek employment with organizations pursuing RSO Certification
   - Review Vermont Best Practice Standards for Recovery Services (March 2023)

2. **For Organizations:**
   - Apply for RSO Certification before October 31, 2025 deadline
   - Ensure compliance with Best Practice Standards
   - Plan for SFY27 funding requirements

3. **For More Information, Contact:**
   - Vermont Office of Professional Regulation (OPR)
   - Vermont Department of Health, Division of Substance Use Programs

   - Request: Complete PRSS certification requirements, RSO standards, Best Practice Standards

**Important Note:** Vermont's system is evolving with new organizational certification requirements. The requirement for RSO Certification beginning in SFY27 represents significant change to how recovery services are structured and funded in Vermont.
