# Massachusetts Recovery Coaching Legal Requirements
**Research Date:** January 5, 2025

## MAJOR LEGISLATIVE CHANGE - 2024

**BREAKING:** On December 23, 2024, Governor Maura Healey signed **"An Act relative to treatments and coverage for substance use disorder and recovery coach licensure."**

This legislation establishes the FIRST licensure requirement for recovery coaches in Massachusetts, effective **March 23, 2025**.

## Legal Definition of Coaching

**Status:** WILL BE LEGALLY DEFINED (Effective March 2025)

**New Legal Framework:**
The 2024 legislation creates:
1. New provisions for alcohol and drug counselors and recovery coaches under **MGL c. 111J**
2. A **Board of Registration of Peer Specialists and Recovery Coaches**

**Previous Status (Pre-March 2025):**
The Recovery Coach Commission was established in August 2018 to:
- Gather data
- Review training opportunities for recovery coaches
- Recommend standards for credentialing recovery coaches
- Determine whether recovery coaches should be subject to board of registration

The December 2024 legislation represents the culmination of this commission's work.

**Citation:**
- **MGL c. 111J** (new chapter, effective March 23, 2025)
- Recovery Coach Commission Statute (prior enabling legislation)
- An Act relative to treatments and coverage for SUD and recovery coach licensure (Chapter [to be assigned], Acts of 2024)

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**What does state law say?**
**AWAITING REGULATIONS** - The new law establishes a framework, but specific scope of practice will be defined by the newly created Board of Registration.

**Likely Framework (Based on Commission Work):**
Recovery coaches typically:
- Provide peer support based on lived experience
- Assist with recovery planning
- Connect to community resources
- Provide mentoring and accountability

Recovery coaches do NOT (typical peer support model):
- Diagnose mental health or substance use disorders
- Provide clinical treatment or therapy
- Prescribe medications
- Create clinical treatment plans

**Note:** Specific boundaries will be established by the new board through regulations.

**Citation:** Regulations to be promulgated by Board of Registration of Peer Specialists and Recovery Coaches

## Historical Context

### Recovery Coach Commission (2018-2024):
The commission was charged with:
- Gathering data on recovery coaching
- Reviewing training opportunities
- Recommending credentialing standards
- Determining need for board of registration

**Result:** December 2024 legislation establishing licensure

**This represents 6+ years of work to establish professional standards for recovery coaches in Massachusetts.**

## National Significance

**Massachusetts is the FIRST state to establish specific recovery coach LICENSURE.**

Other states have:
- Voluntary certification (most states)
- Peer support specialist certification (many states)
- No regulation (some states)

But Massachusetts is pioneering **mandatory licensure specifically for recovery coaches**.

This may influence other states' approaches to recovery coach regulation.
