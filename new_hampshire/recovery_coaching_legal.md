# New Hampshire Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** DEFINED IN STATE LAW

**Legal Definition:** RSA 330-C:2 defines "Certified recovery support worker (CRSW)" as "an individual certified by the board to provide recovery support to persons with substance use disorders."

**Key Distinction:** CRSW is a CERTIFICATION (not a full license) specifically for providing recovery support services to individuals with substance use disorders.

**Citation:** New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated (RSA) § 330-C:2

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Regulatory Framework:**
- CRSW credential is overseen by the Board of Licensing for Alcohol and Other Drug Use Professionals
- This is separate from the Board of Mental Health Practice which governs licensed mental health professionals (RSA 330-A)
- CRSW certification is distinct from licensed mental health counselors, clinical mental health counselors, and other licensed practitioners

**Scope of Practice:** Specific scope of practice limitations for CRSW were not detailed in search results. Recommend reviewing RSA Chapter 330-C in full and contacting NH Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC).

**Citation:** RSA Chapter 330-C (Certified Recovery Support Workers); RSA Chapter 330-A (Mental Health Practice Act)

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Certification Authority:**
- Certified Recovery Support Worker credential administered by NH Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC)
- Board of Licensing for Alcohol and Other Drug Use Professionals provides oversight
- Included in New Hampshire's reciprocity rules for professional licenses

**Independent Practice Definition in NH:**
New Hampshire law defines "Independent solo" practice as "practice which is not performed as an employee of an employer who assumes full financial responsibility for the actions of that employee and furnishes the employee with a W-2 form pursuant to US Internal Revenue Services regulations."

**Independent Practice Status for CRSW:**
- Search results did not provide specific information on whether CRSWs can engage in independent practice versus requiring supervision
- Requirements exist for CAPRSS (Connecticut Association of Peer Recovery Support Specialists) Standards for Recovery Coaches and training opportunities, but detailed scope was not provided

**Recommendation:** Contact NH Office of Professional Licensure and Certification or review full text of RSA 330-C for complete certification requirements and scope of practice, including independent practice permissions.
