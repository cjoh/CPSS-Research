# Pennsylvania Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** Defined by certification board (not statute)

**Terminology:** Pennsylvania uses three related certifications:
1. **Certified Peer Specialist (CPS)** - for individuals with lived experience in mental health recovery
2. **Certified Recovery Specialist (CRS)** - for individuals with lived experience in substance use disorder recovery
3. **Certified Family Recovery Specialist (CFRS)** - for family members supporting recovery

**Definition (CRS):** An individual with personal, lived experience of their own recovery from substance use disorder. By offering insight into the recovery process, Recovery Specialists share a unique perspective with those with similar life experiences. The Recovery Specialist is a role model, mentor, advocate, and motivator.

**Key Characteristic:** Based on lived experience, NOT clinical training.

**Citation:** Pennsylvania Certification Board (PCB) definitions and standards

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION (not statutory licensure)

**Independent Practice:** PERMITTED - Recovery coaches/specialists may open their own practice

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** Clearly distinguished through lived experience basis vs. clinical training; must adhere to Code of Ethics and avoid clinical services

**Key Finding:** Pennsylvania allows recovery coaches/specialists to practice independently through voluntary certification system administered by Pennsylvania Certification Board. This is separate from statutory licensure of clinical professionals.

**Important Distinctions:**
1. Certification (CRS/CPS) ≠ Licensure (LPC, LCSW, etc.)
2. Based on lived experience, not clinical degree

5. Encouraged (but not required) to have supervision support

**Practical Guidance for Independent Practice:**

**Allowed:**

- Provide peer support based on lived experience
- Role model, mentor, advocate functions
- Share recovery journey and insights
- Help with engagement in treatment or recovery systems

**Must Avoid:**
- Clinical diagnosis
- Treatment planning (clinical)
- Psychotherapy or counseling
- Presenting as licensed professional
- Crossing boundaries into licensed practice

**Best Practices:**
1. Maintain certification through PCB
2. Complete continuing education requirements (36 hours/2 years)
3. Adhere to Code of Ethics at all times
4. Consider voluntary supervision for support
5. Obtain professional liability insurance
6. Clear service agreements defining non-clinical nature
7. Establish referral relationships with licensed professionals

**Recommendation:** While independent practice is permitted, recovery coaches should maintain clear boundaries, seek supervision support, and ensure they understand the distinction between peer support and clinical services.
