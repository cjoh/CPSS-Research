# Washington State Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** NO SPECIFIC STATUTORY DEFINITION FOUND for "recovery coach"

**Finding:** Search results did not return specific Washington statutes or administrative rules defining "recovery coach" as a distinct regulated profession.

**Related Professions Regulated:**
- Mental Health Counselors (RCW 18.225)
- Marriage and Family Therapists (RCW 18.225)
- Social Workers (RCW 18.225)
- Substance Use Disorder Professionals (SUDPs)

**Key Finding:** Recovery coaching appears to operate in an unregulated or minimally regulated space in Washington State, separate from statutory licensing of behavioral health professionals.

**Citation:** Revised Code of Washington (RCW) Chapter 18.225 (licensed professionals, does NOT include recovery coaches); absence of recovery coach-specific statutes

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Licensed Professional Framework:**
Washington extensively regulates licensed behavioral health professionals under RCW 18.225:
- Licensed Mental Health Counselors
- Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists
- Licensed Clinical Social Workers
- Licensed Mental Health Counselor Associates (must work under supervision)

**Substance Use Disorder Professionals:**
- Prior to June 4, 2024: Required to work in state-licensed behavioral health agency
- **2024 Legislative Change:** Requirement removed; SUDPTs can now work in other clinical practice settings
- **However:** SUDPTs must still work under approved SUDP supervisor; cannot work independently until fully credentialed

**Recovery Coach Status:**
- **NO SPECIFIC STATUTORY SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOUND**
- Not included in RCW 18.225 (Mental Health Counselors, Therapists, Social Workers)
- Not explicitly regulated as separate profession
- **Must avoid activities constituting practice of licensed professions**

**Key Risk:** Without statutory definition, recovery coaches must be extremely careful not to engage in activities that constitute unauthorized practice of licensed behavioral health professions.

2. **No Title Protection:** Anyone can call themselves a "recovery coach" in Washington since the title is not protected by law. This creates potential confusion in marketplace.

3. **No Regulatory Recourse:** If disputes arise with clients or questions about scope arise, there is no regulatory board to provide guidance or adjudicate complaints.

4. **Liability Exposure:** Operating without regulatory framework increases importance of professional liability insurance, clear contracts, and appropriate business structure.

- Managing liability risks

This freedom comes with significant professional and legal responsibility.
