# South Carolina Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** NO SPECIFIC STATUTORY DEFINITION FOUND

**Finding:** Search results did not return specific South Carolina statutes or regulations defining "recovery coach" as a distinct professional category.

**Related Professions Found:**
- **Licensed Addiction Counselors** - regulated under SC Code § 40-75-225, requiring licensure with specific educational requirements (master's degree) and certification credentials
- Professional counselors
- Marriage and family therapists

**Key Finding:** Unlike licensed addiction counselors which are formally regulated under Title 40, Chapter 75, recovery coaches as a distinct category were not found in South Carolina statutory law.

**Citation:** SC Code Title 40 (Professions and Occupations); SC Code § 40-75-225 (Addiction Counselors)

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Licensed Professional Framework:**
South Carolina extensively regulates licensed professionals including:
- Addiction Counselors (SC Code Title 40, Chapter 75)
- Professional Counselors
- Marriage and Family Therapists
- Social Workers

**Recovery Coach Status:**
- **NO SPECIFIC STATUTORY SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOUND** for recovery coaches
- Recovery coaches appear to operate separately from statutory licensing framework
- **No explicit boundary definition found** between coaching and therapy for unlicensed recovery coaches

**Key Risk:** Without statutory definition, recovery coaches must be extremely careful not to engage in activities that constitute practice of licensed addiction counseling or professional counseling.

**Citation:** SC Code Title 40, Chapter 75 (Addiction Counselors); Chapter 33 (Counselors, Marriage and Family Therapists, etc.)

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Regulatory Status:**
- **NO STATE-SPECIFIC LICENSING, CERTIFICATION, OR REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS FOUND** for recovery coaches
- Recovery coaching appears unregulated at state statutory level
- Voluntary certification programs may exist but are not state-mandated

**Independent Practice Status:**
- **UNREGULATED** - No specific state requirements found
- No prohibition on independent practice identified (because no regulation exists)
- No supervision requirements identified
- **CAUTION:** Operating in unregulated space provides no legal framework or protection

**Distinction from Licensed Addiction Counselors:**
- Licensed Addiction Counselors (CAC) require:
  - Formal education (master's degree for higher levels)
  - State licensure under § 40-75-225
  - Continuing education
  - Specific scope of practice
- Recovery coaches: No such requirements found

**Citation:** SC Code § 40-75-225; absence of recovery coach regulations in Title 40

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** APPEARS UNREGULATED - No specific state licensing, certification, or statutory requirements found

**Independent Practice:** NO SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS IDENTIFIED - Permitted by default due to absence of regulation

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** NO CLEAR STATUTORY BOUNDARY - Recovery coaches must avoid activities constituting practice of licensed professions

**Key Finding:** South Carolina does not appear to specifically regulate recovery coaching as a distinct profession in state law. Unlike licensed addiction counselors (which require state licensure), recovery coaches operate in an unregulated space.

**Critical Implications:**

**Advantages of Unregulated Status:**
1. No state certification costs or examination requirements
2. No mandatory training or education requirements
3. No supervision mandates
4. Flexibility in practice structure
5. Lower barriers to entry

**Risks of Unregulated Status:**
1. No legal protection of "recovery coach" title
2. No statutory scope of practice definition
3. No regulatory guidance on permissible activities
4. Potential liability exposure
5. No clear legal framework if disputes arise
6. Must avoid crossing into licensed practice territory

**Recommendations:**

1. **Even Though Unregulated, Recovery Coaches Should:**
   - Obtain voluntary national certification (CARC, NCPRSS, etc.) for credibility and ethical framework
   - Complete comprehensive training in:
     - Trauma-informed care
     - Ethics
     - Boundaries
     - Scope limitations
   - Obtain professional liability insurance
   - Develop clear service agreements defining non-clinical nature of services
   - Establish referral relationships with licensed professionals

2. **Understand Boundaries with Licensed Professions:**
   - **DO NOT** diagnose substance use disorders or mental health conditions
   - **DO NOT** provide clinical treatment or counseling
   - **DO NOT** develop clinical treatment plans
   - **DO NOT** present yourself as a licensed addiction counselor
   - **DO NOT** engage in activities requiring licensure under SC Code § 40-75-225
   - **DO** provide peer support, mentoring, and recovery navigation
   - **DO** refer to licensed professionals for clinical needs

3. **Consider Business Structure:**
   - Form LLC or other business entity for liability protection
   - Obtain appropriate business licenses (general business, not professional license)
   - Consider professional liability insurance
   - Develop clear contracts defining scope of services

4. **Monitor Legal Developments:**
   - South Carolina may develop specific recovery coach regulations in future
   - Stay informed about changes to behavioral health workforce laws
   - Be aware of any new regulations or licensing requirements

**Important Warnings:**

1. **Unauthorized Practice Risk:** Even without specific recovery coach regulations, engaging in activities that constitute practice of licensed addiction counseling could violate SC Code § 40-75-225.

2. **No Title Protection:** Anyone can call themselves a "recovery coach" in South Carolina since the title is not protected by law.

3. **No Regulatory Recourse:** If disputes arise, there is no regulatory board to provide guidance or adjudicate complaints.
