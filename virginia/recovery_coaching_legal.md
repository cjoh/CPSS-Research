## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** STATE REGISTRATION REQUIRED through Board of Counseling

**Independent Practice:** LIMITED - Cannot practice fully autonomously; may work as independent contractor for licensed entities (DBHDS providers, licensed practitioners, licensed facilities)

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** Separate registration from licensed professionals; provides collaborative recovery support, not psychotherapy or clinical counseling

**Key Finding:** Virginia has a unique middle-ground approach:
- REQUIRES state registration through Board of Counseling
- ALLOWS independent contractor status (not just employee)
- REQUIRES affiliation with licensed entity (state agency, licensed provider, licensed practitioner, or licensed facility)
- PROHIBITS fully autonomous independent practice

**Virginia's Unique "Contractor" Model:**

2. ✓ Work as **employee** of qualifying entity
3. ✓ Work as **independent contractor** of qualifying entity
4. ✓ Provide collaborative recovery services
5. ✓ Assist with sustained recovery from addiction/mental illness

**What RPRSs CANNOT Do:**
1. ❌ Operate fully autonomous private practice without licensed entity affiliation
2. ❌ Provide services without connection to licensed entity
3. ❌ Provide clinical psychotherapy or counseling
4. ❌ Practice without state registration

**Qualifying Entities for Employment/Contracting:**
1. Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (DBHDS)

**Virginia's Position on Regulatory Spectrum:**
- **Less Restrictive Than:** Tennessee, Ohio (employee-only), Utah (employee-only)
- **More Restrictive Than:** Pennsylvania, Texas, North Dakota (full independent practice)
- **Unique Position:** Allows independent contractor status while requiring licensed entity affiliation

**Practical Implications:**
