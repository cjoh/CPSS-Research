## Reciprocity and Portability

Kentucky does not have automatic reciprocity with other states. Peer specialists trained in other states may need to:
- Verify their training meets Kentucky's 30-hour requirement
- Complete any additional Kentucky-specific training
- Pass Kentucky's written and oral examinations
- Contact DBHDID for transfer evaluation

## Additional Notes

### Key Features of Kentucky's Program
- Relatively short training period (30 hours) compared to some states
- Both written and oral examinations ensure competency
- Annual certification renewal ensures ongoing professional development
- Wide range of approved training providers offers flexibility
- Affordable options available ($65-$350)
- No specific sobriety duration required - focus on current recovery status
- Includes both mental health and substance use peer support

### Important Considerations
- One-year certification validity requires annual renewal planning
- 6 hours CE requirement is relatively minimal but must be completed annually
- Training costs vary significantly between providers - research options carefully
- Virtual options available for accessibility
- Both individual and employer-sponsored training opportunities available
