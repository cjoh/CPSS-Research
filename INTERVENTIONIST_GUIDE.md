## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I need a license to be an interventionist?**
A: No. Intervention is not a regulated profession in any U.S. state. However, professional certification (CIP, BRI, CAI) is highly recommended.

**Q: Can I call myself an interventionist without training?**
A: Legally yes, practically no. While anyone can use the title, professional practice requires proper training, and clients/treatment centers expect credentials.

**Q: What's the difference between an interventionist and a therapist?**
A: Interventionists facilitate getting someone into treatment. Therapists provide clinical treatment. Interventionists don't diagnose, provide therapy, or treat - they educate, facilitate, and coordinate.

**Q: Do I need CIP certification?**
A: Not legally required, but the most recognized professional credential in the field. Demonstrates competency and commitment to professional standards.

**Q: Can I diagnose addiction?**
A: No. Unless you're separately licensed as a clinical professional, you cannot diagnose substance use disorders or mental health conditions.

**Q: Can I practice in any state?**
A: Since intervention isn't regulated, you can practice in any state (subject to general business licensing). However, if you're also licensed as a clinician, your clinical license is state-specific.

**Q: Do I need malpractice insurance?**
A: While not legally required, it's ESSENTIAL. Intervention involves high-stakes situations and professional liability insurance protects you.

**Q: Can I transport someone to treatment?**
A: Legally yes, though considerations include safety, liability, and your insurance coverage. Many interventionists coordinate transportation rather than provide it directly.

**Q: What if someone refuses to go to treatment?**
A: You cannot force anyone. Intervention is voluntary. If someone refuses, you support the family in next steps (boundaries, consequences, continued offers of help).

**Q: How do I handle dual relationships (family member, friend)?**
A: Don't. Professional interventionists maintain boundaries and refer family/friends to other interventionists.

**Q: Can I bill insurance for intervention?**
A: Generally no. Intervention services are typically not covered by insurance and are private pay.

**Q: What's the liability risk?**
A: Moderate to high. Interventions involve people in crisis, potential violence, suicide risk, and high emotions. Proper training, safety assessment, insurance, and professional conduct are essential.
