# West Virginia Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** Defined through certification board

**Terminology:** West Virginia uses "Peer Recovery Support Specialist" (PRSS) rather than "recovery coach."

**Certification Authority:** West Virginia Certification Board for Addiction & Prevention Professionals (WVCBAPP) - voluntary board certifying qualifications of persons engaged in professional addictions services, member of International Certification & Reciprocity Consortium (IC&RC).

**Definition:** PRSS are individuals with life experience of being diagnosed with serious mental illness or substance use disorder who provide peer-based recovery support services.

**Key Characteristic:** Based on lived experience; must be well established in recovery for minimum of two years.

**Citation:** WVCBAPP standards; IC&RC peer recovery support specialist framework

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Scope of Practice:**
- PRSS must adhere to code of ethics
- Must maintain professional boundaries
- Required to refer clients to licensed providers when necessary
- Role and scope of practice outlined by WVCBAPP and aligned with SAMHSA guidelines

**Licensed Professional Framework:**
West Virginia regulates licensed professionals including:
- Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LICSW) - can practice independently
- Licensed Professional Counselors
- Marriage and Family Therapists
These professionals governed by WV Code Chapter 30 (Professions and Occupations)

**Key Distinction:** PRSS certification is separate from statutory licensing of clinical professionals.

**Citation:** WV Code Title 30 (licensed professionals); WVCBAPP certification standards; SAMHSA guidelines

## Independent Practice Requirements

### CRITICAL FINDING: INDEPENDENT PRACTICE PROHIBITED FOR MEDICAID-REIMBURSABLE SERVICES

**Certification Requirements:**

- Must be well established in own recovery for MINIMUM OF TWO YEARS
- No SUD treatment received for preceding six months (except MAT which is considered part of recovery)
- High school diploma or GED equivalency
