# Oklahoma Recovery Coaching Legal Research

**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** Referenced in administrative code but specific definition not detailed in search results.

**Terminology:** Oklahoma uses "Peer Recovery Support Specialist" (PRSS) rather than "recovery coach."

**Regulatory Reference:** PRSS certification is governed by Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) 450:53, though the full text was not available in search results.

**Citation:** OAC § 450:53 (Peer Recovery Support Specialist certification - full text not available in search)

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Scope of Practice:**
- Peer Recovery Specialists utilized in healthcare settings like Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) to help individuals transition from emergency departments or hospitals to community care
- Operate as part of care transition and support services
- **Specific scope of practice limitations not detailed in available search results**

**Regulatory Framework:**
- Licensed behavioral health professionals (counselors, therapists) governed by Oklahoma State Board of Behavioral Health Licensure under Title 59
- PRSS certification administered separately through ODMHSAS
- **No specific statutory language found** defining boundary between coaching and therapy

**Citation:** Oklahoma Statutes Title 59 (licensed professionals); OAC 450:53 (PRSS); CCBHC Manual 2024

## Independent Practice Requirements

**Certification Authority:**
- Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS)
- Certification governed by OAC Title 450, Chapter 53

**Important Distinction:**
- **ODMHSAS certifies ORGANIZATIONS as specific program types**, not individuals as standalone practitioners
- Some individual certifications offered through separate processes
- Facilities must retain records to verify compliance with PRSS training and certification requirements

**Independent Practice Status:**
- **UNCLEAR** - Search results do not provide explicit information about independent practice permissions
- Organizational certification focus suggests employment-based model
- Lack of individual practitioner certification framework may limit independent practice

**Certification Requirements:**
- Must be certified in accordance with OAC 450:53
- Facilities employing PRSS must retain verification records
- **Specific training hours, examination, and eligibility requirements not detailed in search results**

**Citation:** OAC § 450:53; ODMHSAS certification standards; CCBHC Manual 2024

## Summary

**Regulatory Status:** STATE CERTIFICATION REQUIRED under OAC § 450:53

**Independent Practice:** UNCLEAR - Insufficient information in search results

**Coaching vs. Therapy:** PRSS operate in supportive care transition role; specific boundaries not detailed in available information

**Key Finding:** Oklahoma regulates PRSS through administrative code (OAC 450:53), but the full certification requirements and practice parameters were not available in search results. The focus on organizational certification rather than individual practitioner certification suggests a more restricted practice model.

**Critical Information Gaps:**
1. Complete certification requirements (training hours, examination, eligibility)
2. Independent practice permissions or restrictions
3. Supervision requirements
4. Specific scope of practice limitations
5. Prohibited activities

**Recommendations:**

1. **For Complete Information, Contact:**
   - Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS)
   - Phone: ODMHSAS main line
   - Request: Full text of OAC Title 450, Chapter 53

2. **Review Full Regulations:**
   - Oklahoma Administrative Code Title 450, Chapter 53 (PRSS certification)
   - Oklahoma Administrative Code Title 450, Chapter 27 (Standards for substance abuse services)

3. **Clarify Specific Questions:**
   - Can PRSS operate independent private practices?
   - What supervision requirements exist?
   - What activities are within/outside PRSS scope?
   - What are complete certification requirements?

**Important Note:** The absence of detailed information in search results does NOT mean unregulated practice. OAC 450:53 exists and governs PRSS certification - practitioners must obtain and review the full regulations before practicing.

**Comparison Context:**
- Licensed behavioral health professionals in Oklahoma are governed by Title 59 with clear independent practice authority
- PRSS certification appears to operate under different framework through ODMHSAS
- Organizational certification focus suggests different practice model than licensed independent practitioners
