**Research Date:** November 5, 2025

## Legal Definition of Recovery Coaching

**Status:** NEWLY DEFINED BY 2024 LEGISLATION

**Legal Definition:** Utah Senate Bill 26 (passed February 2024) created the license of "behavioral health coach."

"Practice as a behavioral health coach" means providing services as an employee of a substance use disorder or mental health agency, and working under the general supervision of a mental health therapist, including:
- Care navigation services
- Providing referrals and crisis referrals
- Supporting other behavioral health providers
- Assessments, collaborative planning and goal setting

**Key Exclusion:** "Practice as a behavioral health coach" does NOT include engaging in the practice of mental health therapy.

**Citation:** Utah Senate Bill 26 (2024); Utah Code Title 58, Chapter 60 (Mental Health Professional Practice Act) as amended

## Coaching vs. Therapy Boundary

**Explicit Statutory Boundary:**

**Behavioral Health Coach CAN:**
- Provide care navigation services

- Support other behavioral health providers
- Conduct assessments
- Engage in collaborative planning and goal setting

**Behavioral Health Coach CANNOT:**

- Practice independently (must work under supervision)
- Provide clinical treatment

**Licensed Mental Health Therapy:**
Governed by Utah Code Title 58, Chapter 60. Licensed professionals include:

These professionals CAN practice independently after full licensure.

**Citation:** Utah SB 26 (2024); Utah Code § 58-60-407 (Scope of Practice for licensed professionals)
